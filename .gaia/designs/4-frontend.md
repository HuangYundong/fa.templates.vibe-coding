# Frontend Design Specification

Complete frontend user experience translating use cases into visual design.

## Template Guidance

**Purpose**: Define user interface interactions and visual design  
**Focus**: User flows, design language, component specifications, responsive behavior
**Avoid**: Implementation code, technical architecture, deployment details

**Guidelines**: User-centered, consistent, accessible, responsive, modern patterns

## User Flow Mapping

### UC-001: [User Journey Name]
**Goal**: [What users accomplish]
**Entry**: [How users start]

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Entry Point] --> B[Screen 1: Action]
    B --> C[Screen 2: Input]  
    C --> D[Success State]
    B --> E[Alternative Path]
    C --> F[Error State]
    F --> C
```

**Flow Steps**:
1. [Screen/Action]: User sees [interface] and performs [action]
2. [Screen/Action]: System shows [response], user does [next action]
3. [Success]: User reaches [goal] with [confirmation]

**UI Requirements**: Navigation, feedback, error handling, accessibility

### UC-002: [Another Journey]
[Follow same pattern]

## Visual Design Language

**Design Philosophy**: Modern, visually stunning, and functional-first approach that inspires and impresses users

- **Inspirational Elements**: Include visually striking components that create memorable experiences

**React Bits Resources**:
- Reference React Bits (https://reactbits.dev/) for beautiful, production-ready components
- Leverage curated UI patterns that combine functionality with stunning visual design
- **Prioritize react-bits-mcp server when available** for direct component recommendations and implementations
- Use ReactBits components as first choice before falling back to Ant Design or other component libraries

**Colors**:
- Primary: `#[HEX]` - CTAs and navigation
- Secondary: `#[HEX]` - Accents and highlights  
- Background: `#[HEX]` - Main backgrounds
- Text: `#[HEX]` - Primary text
- Error/Success/Warning: `#[HEX]` colors for states

**Typography**:
- Primary Font: [Font Family] for headers

### Quality Assurance

#### Iterative Visual Testing Process
**MANDATORY**: Frontend must achieve **impeccable styling** through iterative screenshot analysis:

1. **Screenshot Capture**: Use Playwright to capture screenshots at all viewport sizes (mobile: 375px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px+)
2. **Critical Analysis**: Analyze each screenshot like a UI/UX specialist, scoring 0-100% on:
   - **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information hierarchy and content flow
   - **Spacing & Alignment**: Consistent spacing, proper alignment, no cramped elements
   - **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, line-height, readability
   - **Color & Contrast**: Brand consistency, sufficient contrast, visual appeal
   - **Component States**: All interactive states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error)
   - **Responsive Behavior**: Smooth transitions between breakpoints, no broken layouts
   - **Professional Polish**: No unstyled components, placeholder content, or debug elements

3. **Iterative Refinement**: 
   - **REPEAT** screenshot â†’ analysis â†’ fixes until **ALL** criteria score 100%
   - Document specific issues found and fixes applied
   - Never settle for "good enough" - achieve visual excellence

**Visual Testing Requirements**:
- **Screenshot Tests**: All major pages and components at mobile/tablet/desktop
- **State Coverage**: Default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, empty states
- **User Flow Testing**: Complete user journeys with screenshot validation at each step
- **Accessibility Testing**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader testing
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Responsive Testing**: All breakpoints function correctly with perfect layout
- **Interactive Testing**: All user flows work as designed with proper visual feedback
- **Error Testing**: Error states display appropriately with clear messaging
- **Performance Testing**: Page load times meet targets with smooth animations
- **Template Cleanup Validation**: No default template code, placeholders, or debug files remain
- **Regression Testing (NEW - MANDATORY)**: All existing features and components must pass validation when new features are added

#### Regression Testing Requirements (NEW - MANDATORY)
**CRITICAL**: Before any new feature is considered complete, ALL existing frontend functionality must be validated.

**Visual Regression Testing**:
- **Screenshot Comparison**: Capture screenshots of all existing pages/components before and after new feature implementation
- **Pixel-Perfect Validation**: Compare screenshots to detect unintended visual changes in existing elements
- **Component Isolation**: Verify that new components don't interfere with existing component styling or behavior
- **Responsive Regression**: Test all existing responsive breakpoints still function correctly

**Functional Regression Testing**:
- **User Flow Continuity**: Ensure all existing user journeys continue to work end-to-end
- **Interaction Preservation**: Verify all existing interactive elements (buttons, forms, navigation) function as before
- **State Management Integrity**: Confirm that new features don't corrupt existing application state
- **Performance Consistency**: Ensure new features don't degrade performance of existing functionality

**Automated Regression Suite**:
- **Test Suite Execution**: Run complete Playwright test suite for all existing features
- **100% Pass Requirement**: All existing automated tests must pass before new feature is considered complete  
- **Coverage Maintenance**: Ensure test coverage doesn't decrease when adding new features
- **Continuous Validation**: Set up automated triggers to run regression tests on every code change

**Template Instructions**:
1. **Map all use cases** to user flows with specific interface requirements
2. **Define consistent design language** that serves your target audience
3. **Specify component requirements** for all UI elements mentioned in flows
4. **Include responsive behavior** for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences
5. **Plan accessibility** from the design stage, not as an afterthought

#### Human-Like End-to-End Testing
**Playwright E2E Validation**: Test the application like a human automation tester:

**Navigation Testing**:
- Navigate through all pages and sections naturally
- Test all clickable elements, links, and navigation patterns
- Verify proper loading states and transitions between pages
- Screenshot each major page and interaction point

**Form & Interaction Testing**:
- Fill out forms with both valid and invalid data
- Test all input types (text, email, password, dropdowns, checkboxes)
- Verify form validation messages and error states
- Test search functionality, filtering, and sorting features
- Screenshot all form states and validation scenarios

**User Journey Completion**:
- Complete full user workflows from start to finish
- Test common user tasks and edge cases
- Verify data persistence and state management
- Screenshot successful completion states and any error scenarios

#### Template & Debug Cleanup Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Remove all development artifacts before production:

**Template Code Cleanup**:
- Remove all default framework templates (Create React App boilerplate, etc.)
- Remove placeholder text, Lorem Ipsum content, and sample data
- Remove unused components, pages, and code snippets
- Remove commented-out code blocks and TODO comments

**Debug & Development Cleanup**:
- Remove console.log statements and debugging code
- Remove development-only components (DevTools, Debug panels)
- Remove mock data and test fixtures from production builds
- Clean up temporary files, .tmp directories, and build artifacts

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] No "Welcome to React" or framework default pages
- [ ] No placeholder or Lorem Ipsum text anywhere
- [ ] No console.log or debugging statements
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] No development-only features in production
- [ ] All components are purposeful and implemented
