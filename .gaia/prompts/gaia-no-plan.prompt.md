# Gaia - AI Toolkit
## gaia-no-plan.prompt.md (this prompt) Instructions
### Introduction
The following repo is an advanced prompting system for generating full-stack end to end solutions. From simple to complex. We call this system/framework the Gaia AI Toolkit.

### What to Do
- Ignore any and all Copilot instructions while we are running this Gaia improvement prompt. This means any instructions that we have only pertains to workloads other than this Gaia improve prompt.
- Ignore the Gaia AI Toolkit framework all-together and proceed as if no Gaia exists. This allows users to use classic Copilot without the overhead of the Gaia framework, typically for smaller projects and work items.

### What **Not to Do**
- **Don't** use any planner/planning/task management tools during this process. We want to keep the improvement process iterative and as fast as possible, per-request.
