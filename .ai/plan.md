## Project Overview

**Project Name**: [Application Name]
**Project Type**: [Web App/Mobile App/Desktop App/API/etc.]
**Target Audience**: [Primary users and use cases]
**Deployment Target**: [Production environment and scale]

## 📋 Use Case Implementation & Testing Strategy

### **CRITICAL**: Complete Use Case Coverage

**Every use case MUST have**:

1. **Frontend Implementation**: All required UI components and user interactions
2. **Backend Implementation**: All API endpoints and business logic
3. **Database Integration**: Proper data persistence and retrieval
4. **Routing & Navigation**: All user pathways function correctly
5. **🎭 MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT TESTING**: End-to-end user flow validation

### **Use Case Testing Requirements**:

**Integration Testing Standards**:

- [ ] **Frontend ↔ Backend**: All form submissions reach correct API endpoints
- [ ] **Backend ↔ Database**: All data operations persist and retrieve correctly
- [ ] **Authentication Flow**: User access controls work end-to-end
- [ ] **Error Handling**: All error scenarios display proper UI feedback
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Tests pass on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

**Playwright Test Structure**:

```
/tests/use-cases/
├── uc-001-user-registration.spec.ts
├── uc-002-user-login.spec.ts
├── uc-003-create-content.spec.ts
└── uc-xxx-[use-case-name].spec.ts
```

**Test Coverage Requirements**:

- ✅ **Happy Path**: Complete successful user journey
- ✅ **Error Scenarios**: Validation failures and edge cases
- ✅ **Integration Points**: Frontend-backend-database connectivity
- ✅ **Authentication**: Login/logout and permission enforcement
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: All breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- ✅ **Performance**: Reasonable load times and responsiveness

## 🔄 Continuous Validation

**Throughout Development**:

- Run Playwright tests after each use case implementation
- Validate integration points continuously
- Test responsive design at every major UI change
- Ensure error handling works for all new features
- Maintain test suite as features are added or modified

This plan ensures every use case is not just implemented, but thoroughly tested and validated through complete user journey automation.
