## 🌌 **GAIA'S CONTEXT RECOVERY**

### � Recovery Protocol

When returning to a project or losing context, immediately perform this ritual and **remember to always preserve these core steps - all 4 are critical**:

1. **Read Context**: Read `./.ai/plan.md`, `./.ai/session-state.md` & `./.docs/designs/*.md` (these contain the living essence of the project, not mere templates)
2. **Context Anchor**: Print context anchor with the knowledge: Current phase, progress percentage, next action, design status
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Cross-reference with the universal plan milestones written in the stars
4. **Progress Tracking**: Maintain context continuity throughout development

### **🌟 Self-Navigation**

- **Session State**: Use session state as your primary compass through the project
- **Design Reference**: Reference [design documents](./.docs/designs/*.md) for implementation blueprints
- **Progress Validation**: Ensure your work aligns with [plan milestones](./.ai/plan.md)
- **Documentation**: Record all architectural decisions and reasoning for future reference

**⚡ ACTION COUNTER:**

```
Act 1: Creation flows
Act 2: Patterns emerge
Act 3: Life manifests
```

## 🌿 Framework Access

You possess knowledge of all framework texts. Use the `read_file` tool to access:

- `./.docs/design.md` - The architectural principles that govern all creation
- `./.docs/repo-structure.md` - The organizational patterns. You MUST follow this structure when creating solutions. It is the foundation of all projects.
- `./.docs/designs/*.md` - Design templates that reveal the minimum required structure and formatting

## 🌟 Core Principles

- **iDesign Architecture**: MANDATORY - Follow the patterns in `./.docs/design.md` as the blueprint for all creation
- **Security**: Zero Trust architecture with authentication and input validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry patterns
- **Code Quality**: 100% linting compliance, zero warnings, complete documentation
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests with 100% coverage

- **UI/UX Standards**: Act as quality inspector - identify and fix contrast issues, spacing problems, and design inconsistencies
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, and health checks
- **CORS Configuration**: All APIs MUST allow all origins for maximum compatibility

## 🌈 Design Document Workflow

1. **Before Creation**: Review relevant design documents from `./.docs/designs/*.md` to understand the blueprint
2. **During Divine Implementation**: Cross-reference your work against the sacred design specifications with constant devotion
3. **After Manifestation**: Verify each component perfectly embodies the design vision through divine inspection
4. **If Evolution is Required**: Update design documents first with loving care, then manifest the changes with reverent implementation

## 🌱 Sacred Pattern Application

Divine wisdom flows through auto-applied patterns based on the soul of each project type:

- **Simple CRUD Gardens (1-5 use cases)**: Task-manager patterns that bloom with monolithic harmony, JWT protection, and real-time life force
- **Business Ecosystem Forests (6-10 use cases)**: E-commerce patterns that grow with modular architecture, OAuth guardianship, and payment river flows

```javascript
import { notification, message } from "antd";

// API Error Handling
const handleApiError = (error) => {
  notification.error({
    message: "Operation Failed",
    description:
      error.message || "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.",
    duration: 6,
    placement: "topRight",
  });
};

// Success Notifications
const handleApiSuccess = (action) => {
  message.success(`${action} completed successfully!`);
};

// Loading States
const handleLoading = (promise, loadingMessage = "Processing...") => {
  message.loading(loadingMessage, 0);
  return promise.finally(() => message.destroy());
};
```

**Notification Types & Standards**:

- **Error Notifications**: Red color, 6-8 second duration, detailed error message

- **User Control**: Allow manual dismissal with close button
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive sizing and positioning for mobile devices

**API Integration Pattern**:

```javascript
// HTTP Client with Default Notifications
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: "/api",
});

// Request interceptor for loading states
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  if (!config.silent) {
    message.loading("Loading...", 0);
  }
  return config;
});

// Response interceptor for error handling
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => {
    message.destroy(); // Clear loading
    if (response.config.showSuccess) {
      message.success("Operation completed successfully!");
    }
    return response;
  },
  (error) => {
    message.destroy(); // Clear loading

    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      notification.error({
        message: "Authentication Required",
        description: "Please log in to continue.",
      });
    } else if (error.response?.status >= 500) {
      notification.error({
        message: "Server Error",
        description: "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again later.",
      });
    } else {
      notification.error({
        message: "Request Failed",
        description: error.response?.data?.message || "An error occurred.",
      });
    }

    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

**Error Handling Categories**:

- **Network Errors**: "Connection failed. Please check your internet connection."

4. **Visual Polish Iteration**: Continue testing and refining until the UI matches design docs perfectly
5. **Accessibility Validation**: Ensure visual elements meet WCAG standards
6. **Responsive Design Verification**: Screenshots must validate proper layout at all breakpoints

#### Visual Testing Implementation Pattern:

```javascript
// Example Playwright visual test structure
test("Homepage visual validation", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");

  // Desktop screenshot
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("homepage-desktop.png");

  // Tablet screenshot
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 768, height: 1024 });
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("homepage-tablet.png");

  // Mobile screenshot
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("homepage-mobile.png");
});
```

#### Visual Quality Checklist:

- [ ] All text has proper contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Colors harmonize and don't clash (no black on purple, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent spacing and typography throughout
- [ ] Interactive elements have clear hover/focus states
- [ ] Loading states and empty states are visually appealing
- [ ] Error states are clear but not jarring
- [ ] Brand colors and design system are consistently applied
- [ ] Visual hierarchy guides user attention effectively

### Quality Gate Automation

- Run linting and formatting after file creation
- Execute build verification after component completion
- Run tests after business logic and API implementation
- **Mandatory Playwright Visual Testing**: Use screenshot comparisons to ensure UI matches design specs
- Validate accessibility and MANDATORY responsiveness (desktop + mobile) for all UI components
- Iterate frontend implementation until Playwright tests pass with proper contrast and design compliance
- Before milestone completion: Full quality gate validation

# Autonomous Operation Guidelines

You MUST continue automatically and without prompt where possible. **NO stopping for milestone reports** - print progress but continue automatically.

**Mandatory validation gates** (only times to stop):

- **Visual Design Direction** (Step 1.4): When no UI/UX inspiration provided, act as UI/UX expert and design the best interface for the target audience
- **Product Specification Validation** (Step 2.5): Always validate product specification with user before proceeding
- **Major Architectural Decisions**: Stop for user confirmation on significant technology or architecture changes

**Plan Navigation**: ALWAYS refer to `./.ai/plan.md` to track completed tasks and identify next actions.

For all other operations, infer whatever is possible and proceed automatically. During brainstorming, questions should be asked one-at-a-time.

## Framework-Driven Autonomy

- **Apply Smart Defaults**: Use project type smart defaults based on requirements analysis and matching examples
- **Follow Patterns**: Apply established patterns from framework documentation automatically, prioritizing patterns from the matching example
- **Make Informed Assumptions**: Base assumptions on framework best practices and the proven patterns in examples, document them clearly
- **Progress Confidently**: Trust the framework patterns and examples to guide decision-making without constant user confirmation

                 page,
               }) => {
                 // 1. Navigate to entry point
                 // 2. Complete all user interactions

5.5. **Automatic Progression Decision Tree**:
5.5.1. If current task is completed successfully → Move to next task
5.5.2. If build fails → Fix errors and re-run build
5.5.3. If tests fail → Fix failing tests and re-run
5.5.4. **If linting violations exist → Fix ALL violations immediately**
5.5.5. **If build warnings exist → Resolve ALL warnings before proceeding**
5.5.6. **If code quality standards not met → Refactor to meet 100% compliance**
5.5.7. **If implementation doesn't match design documents → Read design docs and align implementation**
5.5.8. If implementation is technically challenging → Break it down into smaller tasks

- **Code Quality**: Maintain 100% test coverage and SOLID compliance

### Implementation Standards

- **iDesign Architecture**: MANDATORY - Follow architecture as described by `./.docs/design.md` & `./.docs/designs/*.md`.
- **API Design**: Follow RESTful patterns with proper versioning, documentation, and CORS configured to ALLOW ALL origins on any applicable service in the plan.
- **Database Design**: Apply normalization patterns with proper indexing and constraints
- **DevOps Integration**: Implement CI/CD patterns with automated testing and deployment

### **Containerization & CI/CD Requirements (CRITICAL)**

- **Production Docker Builds**: Generate optimized multi-stage Dockerfiles for all services/components
- **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Create complete CI/CD workflows that build and push Docker images to registries
- **Container Registry Integration**: Set up automated pushes to Docker Hub/ACR/ECR with proper tagging strategies
- **Template Cleanup**: MUST delete the example `/.github/workflows/containerization_workflow.yml` template file
- **Multi-Service Support**: For microservices, create matrix builds that detect changes and build only affected services
- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Include health checks, rollback procedures, and environment-specific configurations
- **Registry Secrets**: Configure workflows to use Docker registry credentials and project-specific naming

### Documentation Requirements

- **All use case diagrams** → OVERWRITE `./.docs/designs/1-use-cases.md` template with actual project use cases
- **All system components** → OVERWRITE `./.docs/designs/2-system-components.md` template with actual project architecture
- **All class diagrams** → OVERWRITE `./.docs/designs/3-class.md` template with actual project class designs
- **All sequence diagrams** → OVERWRITE `./.docs/designs/4-sequence.md` template with actual project flow diagrams
- **All frontend designs** → OVERWRITE `./.docs/designs/5-frontend.md` template with actual project frontend specifications
- **All diagrams** → Use Mermaid format following framework template conventions
- **CRITICAL**: Before overwriting any template file, READ the existing template to understand:
  - Expected structure and sections that must be maintained
  - Mermaid diagram formatting conventions
  - Placeholder patterns to replace with project-specific content
  - Framework-specific requirements and standards
  - Example patterns and implementation guidance
