# ## üîÑ MANDATORY SYNC PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: Every time you update this session-state file, you MUST:

1. **Read and Review .ai/plan.md** - Understand the complete project plan
2. **Cross-reference Current Progress** - Map current status against plan milestones
3. **Validate Alignment** - Ensure session state reflects plan accurately
4. **Update Plan Tracking** - Mark completed milestones and adjust timeline if needed
5. **üìã UPDATE USE CASE TRACKING** - Sync with .docs/designs/1-use-cases.md and update completion status
6. **Document Deviations** - Note any changes from original plan with rationale
7. **üöÄ AUTOMATIC CONTINUE** - Never stop after sync, immediately proceed to next task

## üöÄ AUTOMATIC CONTINUATION RULES

**GAIA NEVER STOPS FOR REPORTS**:

- ‚úÖ **PRINT milestone status** for visibility
- ‚úÖ **DISPLAY progress updates** for tracking
- ‚úÖ **SHOW completion status** for transparency
- ‚ùå **NEVER PAUSE** for user acknowledgment
- ‚ùå **NEVER WAIT** for milestone approval
- ‚ùå **NEVER STOP** for status confirmation

**Continuation Pattern**: "Milestone [X] completed (Y%). Nurturing the next phase of creation..."tate Template (Enhanced AI Navigation)

## Recovery Commands (For Context Loss)

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE** - Execute in this exact order:

1. `read_file .ai/plan.md` - **FIRST PRIORITY** - Full project plan
2. `read_file .docs/designs/1-use-cases.md` - **SECOND PRIORITY** - All use cases for tracking
3. `read_file .ai/session-state.md` - Current session state (this file)
4. `read_file .docs/designs/*.md` - Design documents status
5. `list_dir src/` - Implementation status
6. `get_errors ["src/"]` - Current issues

**Plan & Use Case Sync Command**: Always run after context recovery:

```
[PLAN-SYNC] Read .ai/plan.md and .docs/designs/1-use-cases.md, cross-reference with current session state, validate milestone progress and use case completion, and update this session-state.md with accurate tracking information.
```

## üîÑ Plan Synchronization Protocol

### When to Sync with Plan

**MANDATORY Sync Triggers**:

- At the start of every session (context recovery)
- Before beginning any new milestone
- When encountering blockers or scope changes
- Every 3-5 actions (as mentioned in init.md reminder prompts)
- When session state shows >20% progress change
- Before finalizing any major architectural decisions

### How to Perform Plan Sync

1. **Read Plan**: `read_file .ai/plan.md`
2. **Compare Status**: Match current progress against plan milestones
3. **Identify Gaps**: Note any missing or incomplete items from plan
4. **Update Tracking**: Mark completed items, update progress percentages
5. **Document Changes**: Record any deviations or scope adjustments
6. **Validate Next Steps**: Ensure next actions align with plan priorities
7. **üöÄ IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE**: Never stop after sync - proceed to next task automatically

### Plan Sync Quality Checklist

- [ ] Plan has been read in current session
- [ ] Milestone status accurately reflects plan
- [ ] Progress tracking is mathematically consistent
- [ ] Next actions are derived from plan priorities
- [ ] Any plan deviations are justified and documented
- [ ] Timeline adjustments are realistic and explained
- [ ] **üöÄ Automatic continuation**: Ready to proceed without user confirmation

**Remember**: The plan is the source of truth. Session state should reflect plan reality, not replace it. **ALWAYS CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY AFTER SYNC**.
