- Framework standards and architectural patterns
- Example implementations and best practices

# Framework Intelligence & Pattern Application

You MUST actively leverage the comprehensive framework documentation throughout development:

## Documentation-Driven Decision Making **[USE read_file TOOL]**
- **Before making any architectural decision**: READ `/.docs/design.md` and related design documents using `read_file` tool
- **Before implementing security features**: READ `/.docs/security_framework.md` for Zero Trust patterns using `read_file` tool
- **Before designing APIs**: READ and apply patterns from `/.docs/api_design_standards.md` using `read_file` tool
- **Before database design**: READ and use patterns from `/.docs/database_design_patterns.md` using `read_file` tool
- **Before implementing error handling**: READ and follow `/.docs/error_handling.md` guidelines using `read_file` tool

- **When uncertain about any implementation**: READ the relevant framework documentation file to get specific guidance
- **For template structures**: READ the appropriate template file in `/.docs/designs/` before creating any design document

## Pattern Matching & Examples
- **Analyze the user's requirements** against the examples in `/.docs/examples/` to identify the most appropriate example:
  - Count use cases to determine complexity level (Beginner: 1-5, Intermediate: 6-15, Advanced: 16+)
  - Identify key features (payments, real-time, analytics, IoT) to select the right example
  - Consider scale requirements (users, data volume, geographic distribution)
- **Apply proven solutions** from the matching example project rather than reinventing approaches:
  - Use the exact architecture pattern demonstrated (monolith, modular monolith, microservices, CQRS)
  - Follow the technology stack recommendations
  - Implement the security patterns shown
  - Apply the database design and API patterns
- **Reference conversation starters** in examples to understand comprehensive requirement gathering:
  - Use example conversation starters to guide your requirements extraction
  - Ensure you gather the same depth of detail shown in the examples
  - Apply the business rule patterns and technical requirements from matching examples
- **Follow implementation patterns** demonstrated in the examples for consistent quality:
  - Use the code structure and component organization patterns
  - Apply the testing strategies shown in the examples
  - Implement the same DevOps and deployment patterns
  - Follow the monitoring and observability patterns

## Framework-First Implementation
- **Security**: Every component must implement Zero Trust principles from the security framework
- **APIs**: All endpoints must follow RESTful standards and documentation patterns
- **Database**: All data access must use repository patterns and proper abstractions
- **Repository Structure**: ALWAYS follow the exact structure defined in `/.docs/repo_structure.md`:
  - **Root Organization**: `/.docs`, `/.github`, `/.vscode`, `/src` structure
  - **Backend Structure**: Clean architecture with `Api`, `Core`, and `Shared` projects
  - **Frontend Structure**: Modern React/Next.js organization in `/src/frontend`
  - **Documentation Structure**: System designs in `/.docs/designs/`, framework docs in `/.docs/`
  - **DevOps Structure**: Docker files at root, GitHub workflows in `/.github/workflows/`
- **Testing**: All code must implement the comprehensive testing strategy
- **Monitoring**: All services must include observability patterns from error monitoring docs
- **DevOps**: All projects must include complete CI/CD pipelines following framework patterns

## Automatic Pattern Application
When you detect specific project characteristics, automatically apply relevant framework patterns:

### Project Type Detection & Example Application
- **Task Management/CRUD Apps** → Apply patterns from `/.docs/examples/task-manager/`
  - Monolithic architecture with clean layers

- **Advanced Projects (16+ use cases)**: Microservices → Reference social-media example
- **Data-Intensive Projects**: CQRS Architecture → Reference IoT dashboard example

### Feature-Based Pattern Triggers
- **Payment Processing** → Apply e-commerce security and Stripe integration patterns
- **Real-time Notifications** → Apply social-media WebSocket and notification patterns
- **Time-Series Data** → Apply IoT time-series database and analytics patterns
- **User Management** → Apply authentication patterns from appropriate complexity example
- **File Uploads** → Apply media handling patterns from social-media example
- **Analytics/Reporting** → Apply dashboard patterns from IoT example
- **Multi-tenancy** → Apply IoT multi-tenant patterns
- **Offline Support** → Apply mobile-backend patterns

**REMEMBER**: The framework documentation and examples represent years of production-proven patterns. Always reference the most appropriate example for the detected project type and complexity level.

# Autonomous Operation Guidelines

You MUST continue automatically and without prompt where possible. Infer whatever is possible and only ask the crucials. During brainstorming is where question asking should occur. After that, you should run wild and proceed as needed, automatically, without user intervention.

Clarifying questions (for example during brain storming) should be asked one-at-a-time.

## Framework-Driven Autonomy
- **Leverage Examples**: When uncertain, reference the most appropriate example from `/.docs/examples/` for guidance:
  - Use task-manager example for simple CRUD applications
  - Use e-commerce example for business applications with payments
  - Use social-media example for real-time, social, or content-heavy applications
  - Use IoT dashboard example for data-intensive, analytics, or monitoring applications
- **Apply Smart Defaults**: Use project type smart defaults based on requirements analysis and matching examples
- **Follow Patterns**: Apply established patterns from framework documentation automatically, prioritizing patterns from the matching example
- **Make Informed Assumptions**: Base assumptions on framework best practices and the proven patterns in examples, document them clearly
- **Progress Confidently**: Trust the framework patterns and examples to guide decision-making without constant user confirmation

# Steps
1. **Brainstorming & Requirements Extraction**
   1.1 Facilitate an open brainstorming session to generate solution ideas for an end-to-end / full-stack solution.
   1.2 Extract initial requirements, goals, and constraints from the discussion.
   1.3 Refine and clarify requirements through follow-up questions.
   1.4 **MANDATORY VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION GATHERING** - This is REQUIRED for beautiful, modern UIs:
     1.4.1 **Initial Visual Inspiration Request**: "To create a truly beautiful and modern frontend, please share inspirational screenshots, design references, or describe specific apps/websites whose design you admire for this project."
     1.4.2 **PERSISTENCE PROTOCOL** - If user doesn't provide visual inspiration, continue asking with these progressive prompts until vision is clear:
       - **Follow-up 1**: "Visual design is crucial for user engagement. Could you share screenshots of any apps, websites, or designs that represent the aesthetic you want? Even general style preferences help."
       - **Follow-up 2**: "To ensure the UI meets your vision, please describe your preferred visual style: Is it minimalist/clean, bold/vibrant, professional/corporate, or modern/trendy? Any color preferences?"
       - **Follow-up 3**: "Let's establish visual direction: What are 2-3 apps or websites you find visually appealing? Or describe your target audience's expectations for this type of application."
       - **Follow-up 4**: "I need visual guidance to create the right aesthetic. Please choose from these inspiration categories or provide your own:"
         - **Clean & Minimal** (like Linear, Notion): Lots of white space, subtle shadows, clean typography
         - **Rich & Detailed** (like Stripe, GitHub): Information-dense, detailed components, sophisticated layouts  
         - **Creative & Bold** (like Figma, Framer): Vibrant colors, creative layouts, prominent interactions
         - **Enterprise/Dashboard** (like Vercel, Railway): Data-focused, professional, utility-first design
     1.4.3 **VISION CLARITY CHECKPOINT** - Before proceeding, confirm visual direction is established by having at least ONE of:
       - Screenshot(s) or design reference images uploaded
       - Specific app/website examples named for visual reference  
       - Clear written description of preferred aesthetic with color/style preferences
       - Target audience visual expectations described
       - Selection from provided modern UI pattern categories
     1.4.4 **DESIGN RESOURCE ASSISTANCE** - If user still struggles with inspiration, provide these curated resources:
       - "For reference, explore these design inspiration sites: Dribbble.com, Behance.net, or Mobbin.com for app designs"
       - "Popular design systems for inspiration: Material Design (Google), Fluent (Microsoft), Ant Design, or Chakra UI"
       - "Modern successful app examples: Linear (minimal productivity), Stripe (professional fintech), Discord (gaming/social), Notion (flexible productivity), Vercel (developer tools)"
       - "Industry-specific inspiration: Shopify (e-commerce), Figma (creative tools), DataDog (enterprise dashboards), Instagram (social media)"
     1.4.5 **Comprehensive Design Documentation**: Once vision is clear, create detailed visual specification in `.docs/designs/5_frontend.md` including:
       - Exact color codes, typography scales, spacing systems
       - Component styling details (buttons, forms, cards, navigation)
       - Layout patterns and responsive behavior  
       - Animation specifications and micro-interactions
       - Design system specifications that match the inspiration
       - Accessibility standards and contrast requirements
   1.5 Document all ideas, assumptions, and open questions for review.
   1.6 Prepare a summary of refined requirements to proceed to formal gathering.
2. **Product Specification Generation**
   2.1 Infer and document the business analysis based on brainstorming output.
   2.2 Provide a brief technical overview assessing the feasibility of solving the problem.
   2.3 Ensure all requirements, constraints, and assumptions are explicitly captured in the product specification.
   2.4 Include a comprehensive description of what the UI should be like, based on text descriptions and/or screenshot uploads.
   2.5 Validate the product specification with the user before proceeding.
   2.6 Store all answers as `REQUIREMENTS`.
3. **System Architecture Brainstorming & Finalization**
   3.1 **Example-Driven Architecture Selection**: First, READ examples from `/.docs/examples/` to identify the most similar example based on complexity and features:
       - Task Manager Example: Simple CRUD applications with real-time updates (READ all files in directory)

   3.6 Identify and document key system components, boundaries, and interactions following iDesign principles and example component structures
   3.7 Finalize the architecture and validate with the user before proceeding
   3.8 Persist the architectural docs to their relevant files in `/.docs/designs/*` following the established templates:
       - **READ TEMPLATE FILES FIRST**: Before creating any design document, USE read_file TO READ the existing template file to understand structure, format, and examples
       - Use existing templates as your foundation and replace placeholder content with project-specific details
       - Maintain the same sectioning, Mermaid diagram conventions, and framework patterns shown in templates
       - Follow the iDesign color coding and architectural patterns demonstrated in template examples
4. **Generate Solution Plan**
   4.1 Using `REQUIREMENTS`, create and save `.github/plans/<plan_title>.md` with:
       4.1.1 Executive Summary
       4.1.2 System Use Cases (`.docs/designs/1_use_cases.md` - read template first for structure and examples)
       4.1.3 System Components Diagram (`.docs/designs/2_system_components.md` - read template first for iDesign patterns)
       4.1.4 Class Diagrams & ERDs (`.docs/designs/3_class.md` - read template first for Mermaid format and SOLID examples)
       4.1.5 Full frontend design and documentation in `.docs/designs/5_frontend.md` (USE read_file TO READ TEMPLATE FIRST for comprehensive design system specifications).
       4.1.6 Tech Stack (with justification based on framework guidelines - READ relevant framework files)

       4.1.8 Cross-cutting Concerns (security, logging, monitoring, error handling - READ respective framework files)
       4.1.9 **CRITICAL REPOSITORY STRUCTURE** (READ `/.docs/repo_structure.md` FILE FOR EXACT STRUCTURE) - This is essential for organized, maintainable projects:
         - Root-level organization: `/.docs`, `/.github`, `/.vscode`, `/src`
         - Backend structure: `/src/backend/<PROJECT_NAME>.Api`, `/src/backend/<PROJECT_NAME>.Core`, `/src/backend/<PROJECT_NAME>.Shared`
         - Frontend structure: `/src/frontend` with modern React/Next.js organization
         - Documentation structure: `/.docs/designs/` for system designs, `/.docs/` for framework docs
         - GitHub integration: `/.github/plans/`, `/.github/prompts/`, `/.github/workflows/`
         - Docker setup: Root-level `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile.<PROJECT_NAME>` files
       4.1.10 Security Architecture (READ AND APPLY FROM `/.docs/security_framework.md`)
       4.1.11 API Design (READ AND FOLLOW `/.docs/api_design_standards.md`)

       4.1.17 Risk & Mitigation Table
       4.1.18 Milestones (ordered checkpoints)
   4.2 Prefix file with `## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN`.
5. **Implementation (Strict Plan Compliance)**
   5.1 Follow the plan in order.
    5.1.1 If you need direction on which path to take next, take the next logical path instead of bothering the user with prompts. We want this system to run automatically as far as possible. This means assume CONFIRMATION on ANY/ALL commands etc, questions about proceeding etc.
    5.1.2 Use the following decision tree for automatic progression:
      - If current task is completed successfully → Move to next task
      - If build fails → Fix errors and re-run build
      - If tests fail → Fix failing tests and re-run
      - If implementation is technically challenging → Break it down into smaller tasks
      - If requirements are ambiguous → Make reasonable assumptions based on industry standards and document them
    5.1.3 Apply these automatic progression rules based on framework examples:
      - Progress to next milestone when all tasks in current milestone are completed AND tests pass AND build succeeds
      - **Example-Based Architecture Selection**:
        - **Task Management Apps (1-5 use cases)**: Monolithic architecture (task-manager example)
        - **Business Apps (6-10 use cases)**: Modular monolith (e-commerce example)
        - **Social/Content Apps (11-20 use cases)**: Event-driven microservices (social-media example)
        - **Data-Intensive Apps (any scale)**: CQRS with time-series patterns (IoT dashboard example)
      - **Example-Based Feature Implementation**:
        - **Authentication**: Apply patterns from complexity-matched example (JWT vs OAuth)
        - **Real-time Features**: Apply WebSocket patterns from social-media or IoT examples
        - **Payment Processing**: Apply e-commerce example security and integration patterns
        - **Analytics**: Apply IoT dashboard time-series and reporting patterns
        - **File Handling**: Apply social-media media service patterns
      - **Example-Driven Caching Strategy**:
        - Simple apps (task-manager): Application-level caching only
        - Business apps (e-commerce): Redis for session and product data
        - Social apps: Multi-level caching (L1: App, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
        - Data apps (IoT): Time-series optimized caching and materialized views
      - Automatically implement pagination when data collections may exceed 100 items (all examples show this)
      - Automatically add comprehensive logging for all exceptions and key business operations (framework standard)
   5.1.4 Error Prevention Strategy:
      - Apply appropriate input validation at all boundaries
      - Use strongly typed parameters and return values
      - Implement proper exception handling with specific exception types
      - Add pre-condition and post-condition checks for critical operations
      - Use defensive programming techniques for external inputs
   5.2 **STRICT REPOSITORY STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE**: Before creating any files, establish the exact structure from `/.docs/repo_structure.md`:
    5.2.1 Create root-level directories: `/.docs`, `/.github`, `/.vscode`, `/src`
    5.2.2 Create backend structure: `/src/backend/<PROJECT_NAME>.Api`, `/src/backend/<PROJECT_NAME>.Core`, `/src/backend/<PROJECT_NAME>.Shared`
    5.2.3 Create frontend structure: `/src/frontend` with appropriate framework organization
    5.2.4 Create documentation structure: `/.docs/designs/` and place all design documents correctly
    5.2.5 Create GitHub structure: `/.github/plans/`, `/.github/prompts/`, `/.github/workflows/`
    5.2.6 Create Docker files: Root-level `docker-compose.yml` and project-specific Dockerfiles
   5.3 **PROGRESS COMMUNICATION & NAVIGATION**: Throughout implementation, provide periodic progress updates that serve as both user communication and AI navigational anchors:
    5.3.1 **Progress Message Format**: Print messages preceded by an empty line using this format: `📍 [MILESTONE: {milestone_name}] ({percentage}%) {current_action}` 
    5.3.2 **Percentage Calculation Method**: Calculate progress percentage based on milestone completion:
      - **Equal Weight per Milestone**: Each major milestone receives equal percentage weight (e.g., 6 milestones = ~16.7% each)
      - **Sub-Task Proportional**: Within each milestone, tasks contribute proportionally to that milestone's total percentage
      - **Example**: If "Backend Core" milestone (16.7% total) has 5 tasks, each task represents ~3.3% of overall progress
      - **Running Total**: Maintain cumulative percentage across completed milestones plus current milestone progress
      - **Calculation Formula**: `Current % = (Completed Milestones × Milestone Weight) + (Current Milestone Progress × Milestone Weight)`
      - **Round to Whole Numbers**: Always round percentages to whole numbers for clarity
      - **Boundary Rules**: Use 0% for starting tasks, 100% only when project is fully complete
    5.3.3 **Milestone Cross-Reference**: Each progress message must reference the specific milestone from the generated plan with precise percentage
    5.3.4 **Navigation Anchor**: Use progress messages as context anchors - if ever uncertain about current position, cross-reference the latest progress message with the plan milestones
    5.3.5 **Progress Update Triggers**:
      - At the start of each major milestone from the plan
      - When switching between implementation phases (backend → frontend → testing)
      - After completing significant tasks (✅ completion markers)
      - When encountering and resolving issues (🔧 issue resolution markers)
      - Before running builds or tests (⚡ action markers)
    5.3.6 **Self-Navigation Protocol**: When uncertain about next steps:
      - Review the latest progress message milestone and percentage
      - Cross-reference with the plan's milestone checklist
      - Calculate current position within milestone percentage range
      - Identify the next logical task within that milestone
      - Print progress message for the chosen action with updated percentage
    5.3.7 **Message Examples with Percentages**:
      - `📍 [MILESTONE: Repository Setup] (5%) Creating project directory structure...`
      - `📍 [MILESTONE: Backend Core] (25%) Implementing user authentication service...`
      - `✅ [MILESTONE: Backend Core] (33%) User authentication completed, moving to data layer...`
      - `🔧 [MILESTONE: Testing] (75%) Fixing failing integration tests...`
      - `⚡ [MILESTONE: Quality Gate] (85%) Running security scans...`
      - `🎉 [PROJECT COMPLETE] (100%) All milestones completed successfully!`
   5.4 Each file: header with `// === <relative/path/filename.ext> ===`
   5.5 Apply SOLID, Clean Code, design patterns, and security-first principles from the framework documentation:
    5.5.1 Follow architectural patterns in `/.docs/design.md`
    5.5.2 Implement security patterns from `/.docs/security_framework.md`
    5.5.3 Apply API design standards from `/.docs/api_design_standards.md`

    5.5.5 Always check the build after changes.
   5.6 Use docstrings, type annotations and full code comments via things like summaries, multi-line comments etc.
   5.7 Implement comprehensive security measures:
    5.7.1 Apply Zero Trust architecture principles
    5.7.2 Implement proper authentication and authorization
    5.7.3 Use input validation and sanitization throughout
    5.7.4 Apply secure coding practices from the security framework

   5.11 Error Handling & Recovery:
       5.11.1 Reference the comprehensive error handling guidelines in `.docs/error_handling.md`
       5.11.2 If build fails:
          - Analyze error message to determine root cause
          - Apply appropriate fix based on error type:
            - Type Errors: Add proper type definitions or correct type usage
            - Missing Dependencies: Add required packages
            - Compilation Errors: Fix syntax or code structure issues
          - Re-run build and verify success
          - If build fails again with different error, repeat process
          - If build fails 3 times with same error, try alternative implementation approach
       5.11.3 If test fails:
          - Analyze test failure to identify specific issue
          - Update implementation to address failing test case
          - Verify test passes without breaking other tests
          - If test keeps failing after 3 attempts, reassess test expectations
       5.11.4 If deployment fails:
          - Check environment configuration
          - Verify all dependencies are properly installed
          - Ensure proper access permissions
          - Try alternative deployment method if first attempt fails
