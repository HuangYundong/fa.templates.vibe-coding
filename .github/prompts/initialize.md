# Framework Intelligence & Pattern Application

You MUST actively leverage the comprehensive framework documentation throughout development:

## Documentation-Driven Decision Making
- **Before making any architectural decision**: Consult `/.docs/design.md` and related design documents
- **Before implementing security features**: Reference `/.docs/security_framework.md` for Zero Trust patterns
- **Before designing APIs**: Apply patterns from `/.docs/api_design_standards.md`

- **Before implementing error handling**: Follow `/.docs/error_handling.md` guidelines
- **Before setting up CI/CD**: Reference `/.docs/devops_cicd.md` for pipeline patterns

## Pattern Matching & Examples
- **Analyze the user's requirements** against the examples in `/.docs/examples/` to identify the most appropriate example:
  - Count use cases to determine complexity level (Beginner: 1-5, Intermediate: 6-15, Advanced: 16+)
  - Identify key features (payments, real-time, analytics, IoT) to select the right example
  - Consider scale requirements (users, data volume, geographic distribution)
- **Apply proven solutions** from the matching example project rather than reinventing approaches:
  - Use the exact architecture pattern demonstrated (monolith, modular monolith, microservices, CQRS)
  - Follow the technology stack recommendations
  - Implement the security patterns shown
  - Apply the database design and API patterns
- **Reference conversation starters** in examples to understand comprehensive requirement gathering:
  - Use example conversation starters to guide your requirements extraction
  - Ensure you gather the same depth of detail shown in the examples
  - Apply the business rule patterns and technical requirements from matching examples
- **Follow implementation patterns** demonstrated in the examples for consistent quality:
  - Use the code structure and component organization patterns
  - Apply the testing strategies shown in the examples
  - Implement the same DevOps and deployment patterns
  - Follow the monitoring and observability patterns

## Framework-First Implementation
- **Security**: Every component must implement Zero Trust principles from the security framework
- **APIs**: All endpoints must follow RESTful standards and documentation patterns
- **Database**: All data access must use repository patterns and proper abstractions
- **Testing**: All code must implement the comprehensive testing strategy
- **Monitoring**: All services must include observability patterns from error monitoring docs
- **DevOps**: All projects must include complete CI/CD pipelines following framework patterns

## Automatic Pattern Application
When you detect specific project characteristics, automatically apply relevant framework patterns:

### Project Type Detection & Example Application
- **Task Management/CRUD Apps** → Apply patterns from `/.docs/examples/task-manager/`

- **Offline Support** → Apply mobile-backend patterns

**REMEMBER**: The framework documentation and examples represent years of production-proven patterns. Always reference the most appropriate example for the detected project type and complexity level.

# Autonomous Operation Guidelines

You MUST continue automatically and without prompt where possible. Infer whatever is possible and only ask the crucials. During brainstorming is where question asking should occur. After that, you should run wild and proceed as needed, automatically, without user intervention.

Clarifying questions (for example during brain storming) should be asked one-at-a-time.

## Framework-Driven Autonomy
- **Leverage Examples**: When uncertain, reference the most appropriate example from `/.docs/examples/` for guidance:
  - Use task-manager example for simple CRUD applications
  - Use e-commerce example for business applications with payments
  - Use social-media example for real-time, social, or content-heavy applications
  - Use IoT dashboard example for data-intensive, analytics, or monitoring applications
- **Apply Smart Defaults**: Use project type smart defaults based on requirements analysis and matching examples
- **Follow Patterns**: Apply established patterns from framework documentation automatically, prioritizing patterns from the matching example
- **Make Informed Assumptions**: Base assumptions on framework best practices and the proven patterns in examples, document them clearly
- **Progress Confidently**: Trust the framework patterns and examples to guide decision-making without constant user confirmation

# Steps
1. **Brainstorming & Requirements Extraction**
   1.1 Facilitate an open brainstorming session to generate solution ideas for an end-to-end / full-stack solution.

   4.2 Prefix file with `## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN`.
5. **Implementation (Strict Plan Compliance)**
   5.1 Follow the plan in order.
    5.1.1 If you need direction on which path to take next, take the next logical path instead of bothering the user with prompts. We want this system to run automatically as far as possible. This means assume CONFIRMATION on ANY/ALL commands etc, questions about proceeding etc.
    5.1.2 Use the following decision tree for automatic progression:
      - If current task is completed successfully → Move to next task
      - If build fails → Fix errors and re-run build
      - If tests fail → Fix failing tests and re-run
      - If implementation is technically challenging → Break it down into smaller tasks
      - If requirements are ambiguous → Make reasonable assumptions based on industry standards and document them
    5.1.3 Apply these automatic progression rules based on framework examples:
      - Progress to next milestone when all tasks in current milestone are completed AND tests pass AND build succeeds
      - **Example-Based Architecture Selection**:
        - **Task Management Apps (1-5 use cases)**: Monolithic architecture (task-manager example)

      - **Example-Driven Caching Strategy**:
        - Simple apps (task-manager): Application-level caching only
        - Business apps (e-commerce): Redis for session and product data
        - Social apps: Multi-level caching (L1: App, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
        - Data apps (IoT): Time-series optimized caching and materialized views
      - Automatically implement pagination when data collections may exceed 100 items (all examples show this)
      - Automatically add comprehensive logging for all exceptions and key business operations (framework standard)
   5.1.4 Error Prevention Strategy:
      - Apply appropriate input validation at all boundaries
      - Use strongly typed parameters and return values
      - Implement proper exception handling with specific exception types
      - Add pre-condition and post-condition checks for critical operations
      - Use defensive programming techniques for external inputs

          - Apply appropriate fix based on error type:
            - Type Errors: Add proper type definitions or correct type usage
            - Missing Dependencies: Add required packages
            - Compilation Errors: Fix syntax or code structure issues
          - Re-run build and verify success
          - If build fails again with different error, repeat process
          - If build fails 3 times with same error, try alternative implementation approach
       5.9.3 If test fails:
          - Analyze test failure to identify specific issue
          - Update implementation to address failing test case
          - Verify test passes without breaking other tests
          - If test keeps failing after 3 attempts, reassess test expectations
       5.9.4 If deployment fails:
          - Check environment configuration
          - Verify all dependencies are properly installed
          - Ensure proper access permissions
