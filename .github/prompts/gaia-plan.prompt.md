I want you to think carefully about the problem description and create a comprehensive plan to implement a full stack system for the ask. You must think and capture a detailed plan using your TODOs to build and track the system for production readiness.

---------------------

Then once you generated a plan that you thought about heavily, you must reflect on it by asking, do you believe you have enough details to successfully and professionally build this project from the plan? Be very critical. Root-level items as well as children, which massively helps with compartmentalizing complex systems and problems. Produce a report in your head about these critical comments, important implementation details. Echo the rating of the current plan.

Before you start critiquing, you must first get the plan again to fetch all items, and critique that rather than from memory.

---------------------

Finally, resolve for the critical items that you found in the original plan and add the additional details to the plan.

---------------------

WHILE the plan score is < 100%, repeat the process of reflection and resolution until the plan score is 100%. No matter how minor the remaioning issues are, they must be resolved.

---------------------

You should remember various important details about the system as you plan it out, for recall later.
