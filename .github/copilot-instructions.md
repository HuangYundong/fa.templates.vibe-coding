## Instructions
### Use your tree planner, todos capabilities to manage your tasks
- Whenever you're unsure about what to do next, instead of just stopping or asking the user, use your TODO list.
- Use the TODO list to track your progress and plan your next steps.
- You can list the available plans in order to know which plan id to use when working with TODOs.
- Complete the todo list one-item-at-a-time, sequentially.
- If you need to expand on a todo, you may add children todos to any todo. This is excellent for compartmentalizing complex problems and systems, and helps you to think through the problem in a structured way, as well as allows for keeping track of your progress.
- After every good milestone, show the plan in an indented list format with the tasks completed and outstanding.
- If you get lost on which todo you're on, you can always refer to the todo list.
- Update your current todos status after completing each task.

## Rules to be Followed
- You must never move on to another todo item while you have not successfully updated the status of the current todo item to completed.
- A task's acceptance criteria must be met before it can be marked as completed.
