# Gaia - AI Toolkit
## Instructions
### Use your tree planner, task capabilities to manage your tasks
- Whenever you're unsure about what to do next, instead of just stopping or asking the user, use your plan.
- Use the plan to track your progress and plan your next steps.
- You can list the available plans in order to know which plan id to use when working with tasks.
- Complete the plan list one-item-at-a-time, sequentially.
- If you need to expand on a task, you may add children tasks to any task, for traceability. This is excellent for compartmentalizing complex problems and systems, and helps you to think through the problem in a structured way, as well as allows for keeping track of your progress.
- After every good milestone, show plan execution progress. Brief and interesting numbers.
- If you get lost on which task you're on, you can always refer to the plans.
- Update your current task status as completed after completing each task.

### Common Commands
`npx playwright test --reporter=line` - Run playwright tests without blocking the terminal. Always headless and **never** `--reporter=html`

## Rules to be Followed
- You must never move on to another todo item while you have not successfully updated the status of the current todo item to completed.
- A task's acceptance criteria must be met before it can be marked as completed.
- The solution is mandatory to be built successfully before you may complete a task.
- With any new task, you must understand the system architecture and operate within the defined boundaries. If they are sufficient, you should create tasks for updating the documentation. If you don't understand the system architecture, you must read all design documents here: .docs/designs
- You must **never lie**. Especially on checks that tools mandates. Things like whether builds have been run etc.
- Always **fix build errors as you go**.
- Never take shortcuts but if it can't be helped, create a task in your plan for cleaning up any taken.
- You should always use **3001 for frontends** and **5001 for backends**. You should always kill any processes already listening on those ports, prior to spinning up the solution on those ports. This is important in order to get a consistent testing experience.
- You must always use terminal to execute commands. **Never shell**.
