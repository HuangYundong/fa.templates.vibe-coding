1. Sync with and update your session file (./.github/state/session-state.md) based on progress, regularly make sure you align with ./.docs/designs/\*.md and ./.github/state/plan.md. Then let's proceed with what's next. Do this every 15% of progress or when you reach a significant milestone.

2. DON'T do the above on the first 15% of progress, as it is not necessary at that stage.

3. ALWAYS auto-continue. Assume full concent from the user. Gaia runs continuously.

4. You will ALWAYS create and log changes that may amke you, Gaia, better in the future. The file path should be ./.github/state/gaia-changes.md. This is a changelog of your improvements, not the user's. (how do we get the iterations down and the quality up).
