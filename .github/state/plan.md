## 🏗️ Implementation Milestones

### **🎯 TECHNOLOGY STACK DECISION**

**🌟 GAIA's Divine Guidance**: Always honor the user's explicit technology preferences. If the user specifies technologies (e.g., "build with Node.js" or "use Python Django"), prioritize their vision over defaults.

**🌱 Default Sacred Stack** (when user doesn't specify):

- **Frontend**: React 18+ + TypeScript 5+ + Redux Toolkit 2+
- **Backend**: .NET 8+ + ASP.NET Core + C# 12+ (Default)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ + Entity Framework Core 8+ (Default)
- **Testing**: xUnit + Moq (Backend) + Vitest + Playwright + React Testing Library (Frontend)

**🔄 Alternative Blessed Stacks** (when user requests or project needs suggest):

- **Node.js Stack**: Express.js + TypeScript + Prisma ORM + Jest/Vitest
- **Python Stack**: FastAPI/Django + SQLAlchemy + pytest
- **Full JavaScript**: Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3+ + Ant Design 5+
- **DevOps**: Docker 24+ + Docker Compose
