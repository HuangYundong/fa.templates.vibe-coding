# Gaia Framework - Suggested Improvements Log

## 2025-06-18 - BurnCircle React Debugging Session

### Critical Issues Identified

**React App Runtime Failure**:
- 530 Playwright tests failing due to React components not mounting
- 67 TypeScript compilation errors preventing app initialization
- Need better error propagation from build/dev server to test runner

### Suggested Framework Improvements

**1. Enhanced Error Detection** 
- Auto-detect compilation errors in dev servers before running tests
- Surface JavaScript runtime errors more prominently in test output

**2. Better Build Validation**
- Validate React app mounting before proceeding with UI tests
- Include build health checks in test setup phase

**3. Improved Debugging Tools**
- Automated console/error capture in test scaffolding  
- Screenshot comparison for identifying rendering failures
- Better integration between dev server status and test execution

**4. Quality Gates**
- Enforce successful compilation before allowing test execution
- Block test runs when fundamental app loading fails

### Impact on Development Velocity

**Current**: 2+ hours debugging React mounting issues with manual investigation
**Improved**: 5-10 minutes with automated error detection and clearer diagnostics

### Implementation Priority

**High**: Build validation and error detection (prevents wasted test runs)
**Medium**: Enhanced debugging tools (speeds up issue resolution)
**Low**: Quality gates (prevents regression but adds complexity)
