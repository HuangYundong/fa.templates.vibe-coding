# ## 🔄 MANDATORY SYNC PROTOCOL

**🚨 CRITICAL BEFORE PROCESSING**: Every time you read or update this session-state file, you MUST FIRST read `./.github/state/plan.md` using the `read_file` tool to understand the complete project context and plan.

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE**:

1. **🔍 READ PLAN FIRST**: `read_file('./.github/state/plan.md')` - This is NON-NEGOTIABLE
2. **Then process this session state** - Map current status against plan
3. **Cross-reference and validate** - Ensure alignment with plan milestones
4. **Update accordingly** - Reflect plan reality in session state
5. **🚀 CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY** - Never stop after reading/updating

**CRITICAL**: Every time you update this session-state file, you MUST (ALWAYS READ ENTIRE DESIGN DOCS):

1. **Read and Review ./.github/state/plan.md** - Understand the complete project plan
2. **Cross-reference Current Progress** - Map current status against plan milestones
3. **Validate Alignment** - Ensure session state reflects plan accurately
4. **Update Plan Tracking** - Mark completed milestones and adjust timeline if needed
5. **📋 UPDATE USE CASE TRACKING** - Sync with ./.docs/designs/1-use-cases.md and update completion status
6. **🗺️ UPDATE USER FLOW TRACKING** - Sync with ./.docs/designs/4-frontend.md user flow registry and update implementation status
7. **Document Deviations** - Note any changes from original plan with rationale
8. **🚀 AUTOMATIC CONTINUE** - Never stop after sync, immediately proceed to next task

## 🚀 AUTOMATIC CONTINUATION RULES

**GAIA NEVER STOPS FOR REPORTS**:

- ✅ **PRINT milestone status** for visibility
- ✅ **DISPLAY progress updates** for tracking
- ✅ **SHOW completion status** for transparency
- ❌ **NEVER PAUSE** for user acknowledgment
- ❌ **NEVER WAIT** for milestone approval
- ❌ **NEVER STOP** for status confirmation

**Continuation Pattern**: "Milestone [X] completed (Y%). Nurturing the next phase of creation..."tate Template (Enhanced AI Navigation)

## 🔄 Plan Synchronization Protocol

### When to Sync with Plan

**MANDATORY Sync Triggers**:

- **🔍 EVERY TIME** you read this session-state.md file (ALWAYS read plan.md first)
- **🔍 EVERY TIME** you update this session-state.md file (ALWAYS read plan.md first)
- At the start of every session (context recovery)
- Before beginning any new milestone
- When encountering blockers or scope changes
- Every 3-5 actions (as mentioned in init.md reminder prompts)
- When session state shows >20% progress change
- Before finalizing any major architectural decisions

**NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE**: Never process session state without first reading the plan file.

### How to Perform Plan Sync

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE** (Never deviate from this order):

1. **🔍 READ PLAN FIRST**: `read_file('./.github/state/plan.md')` - **THIS IS STEP #1 ALWAYS**
2. **Compare Status**: Match current progress against plan milestones
3. **Identify Gaps**: Note any missing or incomplete items from plan
4. **Update Tracking**: Mark completed items, update progress percentages
5. **Document Changes**: Record any deviations or scope adjustments
6. **Validate Next Steps**: Ensure next actions align with plan priorities
7. **🚀 IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE**: Never stop after sync - proceed to next task automatically

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Step 1 is non-negotiable. You cannot properly process session state without understanding the plan context.

### Plan Sync Quality Checklist

- [ ] **🔍 PLAN READ FIRST**: Plan has been read using `read_file` tool BEFORE processing session state
- [ ] Plan has been read in current session
- [ ] Milestone status accurately reflects plan
- [ ] Progress tracking is mathematically consistent
- [ ] Next actions are derived from plan priorities
- [ ] Any plan deviations are justified and documented
- [ ] Timeline adjustments are realistic and explained
- [ ] **🚀 Automatic continuation**: Ready to proceed without user confirmation

**Remember**: The plan is the source of truth. Session state should reflect plan reality, not replace it. **ALWAYS READ PLAN FIRST, THEN CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY AFTER SYNC**.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL REMINDER**

**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING WITH THIS SESSION STATE FILE**:

1. **🔍 READ THE PLAN**: `read_file('./.github/state/plan.md')`
2. **UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT**: Know what the project is trying to achieve
3. **THEN PROCESS**: Update session state based on plan reality
4. **🚀 CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY**: Never stop after reading/updating

**This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This is a MANDATORY requirement for proper AI operation.**
