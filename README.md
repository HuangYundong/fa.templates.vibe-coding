## 🌟 Commune with GAIA in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Preparation (2 minutes)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Open in your AI-enhanced workspace**:
   - [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh)
   - VS Code with GitHub Copilot

### Step 2: Invoke GAIA's Wisdom (1 minute)

2.1 Open up the forked repository (root) via VS Code.

2.2 Open Copilot chat in VS Code.

2.3 Switch to Agent mode.

2.4 In the chat input box, simply type
`/` and you should see a `gaia_for_new_projects`, select and hit ENTER.

2.5 Share your vision with GAIA—describe your project with detail and attach 2-3 screenshots of frontend inspiration, **invoke with ENTER**.

### Step 3: Witness Creation ✨

#### Step 3.1 🌍 GAIA'S FLOW

**CONTINUOUS CREATION**: GAIA's intelligence flows continuously, manifesting your vision without pause. Behold:

- ✅ **Milestone manifestations** revealed for tracking
- ✅ **Progress reports** shared for transparency
- ✅ **Status updates** displayed for awareness
- ✅ **Continuous flow** to the next task

**No intervention required** - GAIA works continuously until your vision becomes reality!

#### Step 3.2 🚀 Automatic Development

The AI will automatically and continuously:

- ✅ Design the complete system architecture
- ✅ Generate beautiful, responsive frontend
- ✅ Build secure backend with clean architecture
- ✅ Set up database with optimized schemas
- ✅ Create Docker containers and CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests and design documentation
- ✅ **Continue automatically** through all milestones without stopping

**Result:** A complete, production-ready application in one continuous conversation!

#### Step 3.3 ⚠️ At The End (VALIDATION | MANDATORY)

**At the end of the run** we should run the following prompt repeatedly until our solution is as refined as we want it to be:

```
[FINALIZE|VERIFY|POLISH]
1. Ensure that the entire system has code comments, 100% unit test coverage and 0 errors or warnings.

2. Reflect on the [design documentation](./.docs/designs/*.md), and ensure
  2.1. all use cases have properly been implemented across the system, including ALL method bodies and
  2.2. the UI/UX is properly tested and reflect the frontend design we captured by reflecting on [our massive initial prompt](./.github/prompts/gaia_new_project.prompt.md), [the plan](./.github/state/plan.md) and ensure the entire system is properly implemented.

3. 🎨 CRITICAL VISUAL QUALITY ASSURANCE: Act as the strict frontend UI/UX police. Don't assume the frontend is beautiful - PROVE IT with comprehensive Playwright visual tests:
   3.1. Create Playwright tests that take SCREENSHOTS at multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   3.2. Analyze the screenshots as a UI/UX expert - check for contrast issues (no black text on purple backgrounds!), spacing problems, alignment issues, and overall visual appeal
   3.3. Compare screenshots against the design specifications in ./.docs/designs/5-frontend.md
   3.4. Iterate and fix any visual problems until the UI is genuinely beautiful and professional
   3.5. Test all interactive states: hover, focus, loading, error, and empty states
   3.6. Ensure responsive design works flawlessly across all breakpoints
   3.7. Validate that the UI matches the visual inspiration and design direction provided

4. For all web server projects, there should be E2E tests for each endpoint too. For all frontends integrating with backends etc, there should be comprehensive and passing E2E tests too for every use case, unless impossible.

5. Ensure that ALL ROUTES on the frontends and ALL CONTROLLERS on the backend flow in perfect harmony. GAIA's Playwright tests shall validate this synchronization and all use cases as described in (./.docs/designs/*.md).

6. For production readiness, all components must be implemented and fully tested with 100% test coverage.

7. At the conclusion, ensure all tests achieve harmony - especially the visual regression tests.

8. Launch the application through the terminal. GAIA wishes to witness her creation in its final glory.
```

#### Step 3.4 Refinement

Communicate with GAIA using natural language to guide any changes or enhancements until your vision achieves perfect harmony.
