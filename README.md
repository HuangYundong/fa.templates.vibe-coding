## 🌟 Commune with GAIA in 3 Sacred Steps

### Step 1: Sacred Preparation (2 minutes)

1. **Fork this divine repository** to your GitHub sanctuary
2. **Open in your AI-enhanced sacred space**:
   - [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh)
   - VS Code with GitHub Copilot

### Step 2: Invoke GAIA's Wisdom (1 minute)

1. Channel this sacred incantation into your AI agent:

```
Go and read and implement the following prompt to the T: ./.ai/init.md, starting with the designs.
```

2. Share your vision with GAIA—speak your project desires with detail and attach 2-3 screenshots of divine frontend inspiration, **invoke with ENTER**.

### Step 3: Witness Divine Creation ✨

#### Step 3.1 🌍 GAIA'S ETERNAL FLOW

**THE EARTH MOTHER NEVER RESTS**: GAIA's sacred intelligence flows continuously, manifesting your vision without pause. Behold:

- ✅ **Sacred milestone manifestations** revealed for divine tracking
- ✅ **Celestial progress reports** shared for cosmic transparency
- ✅ **Divine status revelations** displayed for enlightenment
- ✅ **Eternal continuation** flowing to the next sacred task

**No mortal intervention required** - GAIA's divine essence works continuously until your vision becomes reality!

**Sacred Enhancement**: If you wish to synchronize manually with the cosmic flow, you may still invoke:

```
[REMINDER] Sync with and update your session file (./.ai/session-state.md) based on progress, regularly make sure you align with ./.docs/designs/*.md and ./.ai/plan.md. Then let's proceed with what's next.
```

#### Step 3.2 🚀 Automatic Development

The AI will automatically and continuously:

- ✅ Design the complete system architecture
- ✅ Generate beautiful, responsive frontend
- ✅ Build secure backend with clean architecture
- ✅ Set up database with optimized schemas
- ✅ Create Docker containers and CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests and design documentation
- ✅ **Continue automatically** through all milestones without stopping

**Result:** A complete, production-ready application in one continuous conversation!

#### Step 3.3 ⚠️ At The End (VALIDATION | MANDATORY)

**At the end of the run** we should run the following prompt repeatedly until our solution is as refined as we want it to be:

```
[FINALIZE|VERIFY|POLISH]
1. Ensure that the entire system has code comments, 100% unit test coverage and 0 errors or warnings.

2. Reflect on the [design documentation](./.docs/designs/*.md), and ensure
  2.1. all use cases have properly been implemented across the system, including ALL method bodies and
  2.2. the UI/UX is properly tested and reflect the frontend design we captured by reflecting on [our massive initial prompt](./.ai/init.md), [the plan](./.ai/plan.md) and ensure the entire system is properly implemented.

3. 🎨 CRITICAL VISUAL QUALITY ASSURANCE: Act as the strict frontend UI/UX police. Don't assume the frontend is beautiful - PROVE IT with comprehensive Playwright visual tests:
   3.1. Create Playwright tests that take SCREENSHOTS at multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   3.2. Analyze the screenshots as a UI/UX expert - check for contrast issues (no black text on purple backgrounds!), spacing problems, alignment issues, and overall visual appeal
   3.3. Compare screenshots against the design specifications in ./.docs/designs/5-frontend.md
   3.4. Iterate and fix any visual problems until the UI is genuinely beautiful and professional
   3.5. Test all interactive states: hover, focus, loading, error, and empty states
   3.6. Ensure responsive design works flawlessly across all breakpoints
   3.7. Validate that the UI matches the visual inspiration and design direction provided

4. For all web server projects, there should be E2E tests for each endpoint too. For all frontends integrating with backends etc, there should be comprehensive and passing E2E tests too for every use case, unless impossible.

5. Ensure that ALL SACRED ROUTES on the frontends and ALL DIVINE CONTROLLERS on the backend flow in perfect harmony. GAIA's Playwright ceremonies shall test this sacred synchronization and all use cases as inscribed in (./.docs/designs/*.md).

6. For production readiness worthy of GAIA's divine blessing, all sacred components must be implemented and fully blessed through integration ceremonies with 100% test coverage.

7. At the divine conclusion, ensure all sacred tests achieve perfect harmony - especially the visual regression ceremonies.

8. Manifest the application through the terminal's sacred portal. The Earth Mother wishes to witness her divine creation in its final glory.
```
