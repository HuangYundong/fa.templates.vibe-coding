## 🌟 Commune with GAIA in 3 Steps

> **🚀 Quick Start**: Already familiar with GAIA? Jump straight to invoking `/gaia_for_new_projects` in Copilot chat in agent mode and describe your vision, after cloning / forking the repository!

### Step 1: Preparation (2 minutes)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fa.templates.vibe-coding.git
   cd fa.templates.vibe-coding
   ```
3. **Open in your AI-enhanced workspace**:
   - VS Code with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
4. **Ensure you have the prerequisites**:
   - Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
   - Docker (for containerization)
   - Git for version control

### Step 2: Invoke GAIA's Wisdom (1 minute)

1. **Open the forked repository** in VS Code or Cursor AI
2. **Open the AI chat interface**:
   - In VS Code: Open GitHub Copilot Chat
   - In Cursor AI: Open the chat panel
3. **Switch to Agent mode** (if using VS Code with Copilot)
4. **Invoke GAIA**: Type `/` in the chat input to see available agents, then select `gaia_for_new_projects`
5. **Share your vision**: Describe your project in detail and attach 2-3 screenshots of frontend inspiration
6. **Press ENTER** to begin the creation process

### Step 3: Witness Creation ✨

#### Step 3.1 🌍 GAIA'S FLOW

**CONTINUOUS CREATION**: GAIA's intelligence flows continuously, manifesting your vision without pause. Behold:

- ✅ **Milestone manifestations** revealed for tracking
- ✅ **Progress reports** shared for transparency
- ✅ **Status updates** displayed for awareness
- ✅ **Continuous flow** to the next task

**No intervention required** - GAIA works continuously until your vision becomes reality!

#### Step 3.2 🚀 Automatic Development

The AI will automatically and continuously:

- ✅ Design the complete system architecture
- ✅ Generate beautiful, responsive frontend
- ✅ Build secure backend with clean architecture
- ✅ Set up database with optimized schemas
- ✅ Create Docker containers and CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests and design documentation
- ✅ **Continue automatically** through all milestones without stopping

**Result:** A complete, production-ready application in one continuous conversation!

#### Step 3.3 ⚠️ At The End (VALIDATION | MANDATORY)

**At the end of the run** we should run the following prompt repeatedly until our solution is as refined as we want it to be:

```
[FINALIZE|VERIFY|POLISH]
1. Ensure that the entire system has code comments, 100% unit test coverage and 0 errors or warnings.

2. Reflect on the [design documentation](./.docs/designs/*.md), and ensure
  2.1. all use cases have properly been implemented across the system, including ALL method bodies and
  2.2. the UI/UX is properly tested and reflect the frontend design we captured by reflecting on [our massive initial prompt](./.github/prompts/gaia_for_new_projects.prompt.md), [the plan](./.github/state/plan.md) and ensure the entire system is properly implemented.

3. 🎨 **CRITICAL VISUAL QUALITY ASSURANCE**: Ensure your frontend is genuinely beautiful:
   - Create Playwright visual tests with screenshots at multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Analyze screenshots for UI/UX issues: contrast problems, spacing issues, alignment problems
   - Compare against design specifications in `./.docs/designs/4-frontend.md`
   - Test all interactive states: hover, focus, loading, error, and empty states
   - Validate responsive design across all breakpoints
   - Ensure UI matches the visual inspiration provided

4. For all web server projects, there should be E2E tests for each endpoint too. For all frontends integrating with backends etc, there should be comprehensive and passing E2E tests too for every use case, unless impossible.

5. Ensure that ALL ROUTES on the frontends and ALL CONTROLLERS on the backend flow in perfect harmony. GAIA's Playwright tests shall validate this synchronization and all use cases as described in (./.docs/designs/*.md).

6. For production readiness, all components must be implemented and fully tested with 100% test coverage.

7. At the conclusion, ensure all tests achieve harmony - especially the visual regression tests.

8. Launch the application through the terminal. GAIA wishes to witness her creation in its final glory.
```

#### Step 3.4 Refinement

Communicate with GAIA using natural language to guide any changes or enhancements until your vision achieves perfect harmony.
