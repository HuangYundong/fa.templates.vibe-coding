<h3 align="center">🚀 The AI Coding Framework: Smart Software Development</h3>

**Transform your ideas into production-ready applications in minutes. Just describe what you want to build, and our intelligent AI framework handles the rest.**

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Open in your AI-powered IDE**:
   - [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh)
   - VS Code with GitHub Copilot

### Step 2: Tell the AI What You Want (1 minute)

1. Paste the following prompt into your agent:

```
Go and read and implement the following prompt to the T: .ai/init.md, starting with the designs.
```

2. Describe your project with as much or little detail as you'd like and attach 2-3 screenshots of design inspirations for frontend projects, **hit ENTER**.

### Step 3: Watch the Magic ✨

#### Step 3.1 🚀 AUTOMATIC CONTINUATION

**GAIA NEVER STOPS**: The system now automatically continues without requiring "Continue" prompts. You'll see:

- ✅ **Milestone updates** displayed for visibility
- ✅ **Progress reports** shown for tracking
- ✅ **Status updates** printed for transparency
- ✅ **Automatic continuation** to the next task

**No user intervention needed** - GAIA will work continuously until completion!

**Optional Enhancement**: If you want to sync manually, you can still use:

```
[REMINDER] Sync with and update your session file (./.ai/session-state.md) based on progress, regularly make sure you align with ./.docs/designs/*.md and ./.ai/plan.md. Then let's proceed with what's next.
```

#### Step 3.2 🚀 Automatic Development

The AI will automatically and continuously:

- ✅ Design the complete system architecture
- ✅ Generate beautiful, responsive frontend
- ✅ Build secure backend with clean architecture
- ✅ Set up database with optimized schemas
- ✅ Create Docker containers and CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests and design documentation
- ✅ **Continue automatically** through all milestones without stopping

**Result:** A complete, production-ready application in one continuous conversation!

#### Step 3.3 ⚠️ At The End (VALIDATION | MANDATORY)

**At the end of the run** we should run the following prompt repeatedly until our solution is as refined as we want it to be:

```
[FINALIZE|VERIFY|POLISH]
1. Ensure that the entire system has code comments, 100% unit test coverage and 0 errors or warnings.

2. Reflect on the [design documentation](.docs/designs/*.md), and ensure
  2.1. all use cases have properly been implemented across the system, including ALL method bodies and
  2.2. the UI/UX is properly tested and reflect the frontend design we captured by reflecting on [our massive initial prompt](.ai/init.md), [the plan](.ai/plan.md) and ensure the entire system is properly implemented.

3. 🎨 CRITICAL VISUAL QUALITY ASSURANCE: Act as the strict frontend UI/UX police. Don't assume the frontend is beautiful - PROVE IT with comprehensive Playwright visual tests:
   3.1. Create Playwright tests that take SCREENSHOTS at multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   3.2. Analyze the screenshots as a UI/UX expert - check for contrast issues (no black text on purple backgrounds!), spacing problems, alignment issues, and overall visual appeal
   3.3. Compare screenshots against the design specifications in .docs/designs/5-frontend.md
   3.4. Iterate and fix any visual problems until the UI is genuinely beautiful and professional
   3.5. Test all interactive states: hover, focus, loading, error, and empty states
   3.6. Ensure responsive design works flawlessly across all breakpoints
   3.7. Validate that the UI matches the visual inspiration and design direction provided

4. For all web server projects, there should be E2E tests for each endpoint too. For all frontends integrating with backends etc, there should be comprehensive and passing E2E tests too for every use case, unless impossible.

5. Ensure that ALL ROUTES on the frontends and ALL CONTROLLERS on the backend should be working flawlessly. There should be Playwright tests for this and all our use cases as specified in (./docs/designs/*.md).

6. In order for the system to be production-ready we need the various components, to be implemented and fully integration tested where possible and 100% test coverage.

7. At the end, ensure all tests pass one last time - especially the visual regression tests.

8. Open up the application / website via the terminal. I want to see the end-result, at the end.
```

#### Step 3.4 Polishing

Use natural language with the agent on any changes or fixes you'd like to make, until happy.

## 🧠 Advanced AI Intelligence (What Makes This Smart)

### 🎨 Visual Intelligence

- **Design Context Awareness**: Processes visual inspiration to create stunning, modern UIs
- **Brand Adaptation**: Applies your color preferences and design style automatically
- **Responsive Excellence**: Ensures beautiful experiences across all devices

### 🛡️ Built-in Quality & Security

- **Zero Tolerance Standards**: 100% test coverage, zero build warnings, perfect linting
- **🎨 Visual Quality Assurance**: Mandatory Playwright screenshot testing to ensure genuinely beautiful, professional UIs
- **Contrast & Accessibility**: Automated detection of poor contrast (no black text on purple backgrounds!)
- **Security by Default**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, and security scanning
- **Production Ready**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, monitoring, and deployment

## 💡 Perfect For Building

The AI automatically detects your project type and applies the right patterns:

| **What You Want to Build** | **What You Get**                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛒 **E-commerce Store**    | Product catalog, shopping cart, payments, admin dashboard |
| 💬 **Chat Application**    | Real-time messaging, user presence, message history       |
| 📋 **Task Manager**        | User accounts, team collaboration, real-time updates      |
| 📱 **Mobile Backend**      | REST APIs, push notifications, offline sync               |
| 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** | Data visualization, reporting, user management            |
