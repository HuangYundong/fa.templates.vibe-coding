# ðŸ¤– Framework Intelligence Enhancement Guide

## Smart Decision Tree Integration

### 1. **Automatic Project Classification System**

#### Complexity Detection Algorithm

```markdown
INPUT: User requirements text
PROCESS:

- Count distinct nouns (entities): user, product, order, payment, etc.
- Identify action verbs: create, update, delete, process, analyze, etc.
- Detect integration keywords: API, payment, email, real-time, etc.
- Calculate complexity score: entities Ã— actions Ã— integrations

OUTPUT: Classification

- Simple (1-5 entities): task-manager pattern
- Medium (6-15 entities): e-commerce pattern
- Complex (16+ entities): social-media pattern
- Data-intensive (any + analytics): iot-dashboard pattern
```

#### Feature Pattern Recognition

```markdown
TRIGGER WORDS â†’ AUTOMATIC PATTERN APPLICATION:

- "payment", "checkout", "billing" â†’ E-commerce security patterns
- "real-time", "live", "instant" â†’ WebSocket implementation
- "analytics", "reports", "dashboard" â†’ Chart libraries + data patterns
- "file upload", "images", "media" â†’ File handling services
- "chat", "messages", "notifications" â†’ Real-time communication
- "admin", "roles", "permissions" â†’ RBAC authorization
```

### 2. **Enhanced Context Retention System**

#### Progressive Context Anchoring

```markdown
ANCHOR FREQUENCY: Every 3-5 actions
ANCHOR CONTENT:

- Current milestone + percentage
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture pattern chosen
- Visual design direction status
- Next 2 immediate actions
- Design document compliance status
```

#### Context Recovery Protocol

```markdown
RECOVERY TRIGGERS:

- Uncertainty about next step
- Build/test failures
- Design document misalignment
- Context inconsistency detection

RECOVERY PROCESS:

1. Read session state file
2. Cross-reference with plan milestones
3. Validate workspace state
4. Rebuild context anchors
5. Resume with progress message
```

### 3. **Smart Framework Guidance System**

#### Documentation-Driven Decisions

```markdown
BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Identify component type (Manager/Engine/Data Access)
2. Read relevant framework documentation
3. Apply patterns from matching example
4. Reference design documents created
5. Validate against framework standards
```

#### Quality Gate Integration

```markdown
AUTOMATIC QUALITY CHECKS:

- Linting: Run after each file creation
- Build: Verify after component completion
- Tests: Execute after business logic implementation
- Security: Scan after authentication implementation
- Design: Validate against design documents
```

## Advanced AI Navigation Features

### 1. **Visual Design Intelligence**

```markdown
VISUAL INSPIRATION PROCESSING:

- Screenshot analysis â†’ Extract color palettes, typography, layouts
- App reference â†’ Apply known design patterns
- Style description â†’ Map to design system components
- Industry context â†’ Apply appropriate visual conventions
```

### 2. **Technology Stack Intelligence**

```markdown
SMART DEFAULTS BY PROJECT TYPE:

- Simple CRUD â†’ Monolith + React + PostgreSQL
- Business Logic â†’ Modular Monolith + .NET Core + Redis
- Social/Real-time â†’ Microservices + WebSockets + Event Bus
- Analytics â†’ CQRS + Time-series DB + ML capabilities
```

### 3. **Error Recovery Intelligence**

```markdown
ERROR PATTERN RECOGNITION:

- Build failures â†’ Dependency issues, configuration errors
- Test failures â†’ Business logic errors, integration issues
- Linting violations â†’ Code style, type safety issues
- Design misalignment â†’ Implementation drift from specs

AUTO-RESOLUTION STRATEGIES:

- Package installation for missing dependencies
- Configuration updates for environment issues
- Code refactoring for quality violations
- Design document updates for specification changes
```
