# Description

This repository follows a structured approach designed for AI-enhanced software development. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the development lifecycle:

## Core Directories

### `.github/` - AI Framework Intelligence & CI/CD Pipeline

The heart of the AI coding framework and automation, containing both the orchestration files that guide the AI through the development process and CI/CD workflows:

- **prompts/**: AI coding framework files - initialization and core intelligence
  - **gaia_for_new_projects.prompt.md**: The master prompt containing comprehensive instructions for AI agents, for brand new projects.
  - **gaia_for_existing_projects.prompt.md**: The master prompt containing comprehensive instructions for AI agents, for continuing on an existing system.
- **state/**: AI planning, session and project state tracking
  - **plan.md**: Auto-generated project plan with milestones, deliverables & tracking of development progress and current status
- **workflows/**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes

### `.docs/` - Documentation Hub

Centralized location for all project documentation:

- **designs/**: System architecture and design documents following the 5-template structure
- **design.md**: Main design document with links to all architectural templates
- **repo-structure.md**: This document explaining the repository organization
- **docker-support.md**: Container setup and deployment guidelines

### `src/` - Source Code Organization

Following clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **backend/**: API and business logic layers with proper dependency injection
- **frontend/**: User interface applications (web, mobile, desktop)

## Configuration & DevOps

### `.github/` - CI/CD Pipeline

- **workflows/**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes
- Supports containerization, security scanning, and multi-environment deployments

### `.vscode/` - Development Environment

- **mcp.json**: Which MCP server(s) should Copilot Chat have access to
- **settings.json**: Consistent code formatting and linting rules
- **extensions.json**: Recommended extensions for optimal development experience

## Project Files

- **README.md**: Main project documentation with quick start guide
- **docker-compose.yml**: Multi-service container orchestration
- **Dockerfile.\***: Service-specific container definitions
- **.gitignore**: Version control exclusion patterns
- **LICENSE**: MIT license for open source distribution

This structure ensures that AI agents can navigate the codebase efficiently while maintaining clean separation between documentation, source code, and infrastructure components.
