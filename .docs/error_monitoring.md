# Error Monitoring & Observability Guide

This document outlines best practices for monitoring, detecting, and responding to errors in your application. Effective error monitoring is crucial for maintaining system reliability and performance.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics to Track

#### Error Metrics
- **Error Rate**: Number of errors per minute/hour/day
- **Error Distribution**: Percentage breakdown by error type/category
- **Error Impact**: Number of users affected by errors
- **Error Duration**: Time until resolution
- **First-time Errors**: New errors not seen before

#### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: Avg/P95/P99 latency for key operations
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Apdex Score**: User satisfaction based on response time
- **CPU/Memory Usage**: Resource utilization
- **Database Performance**: Query execution time, connection pool status

#### Business Impact Metrics
- **Failed Transactions**: Number of critical business operations failing
- **Revenue Impact**: Financial cost of errors
- **User Journey Completion**: Rate of successful user flows

### Alerting Thresholds

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Action |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Error Rate | >1% of requests | >5% of requests | Page on-call engineer |
| P95 Latency | >1.5x baseline | >3x baseline | Auto-scale resources |
| Critical Path Error | >0.1% | >0.5% | Page on-call engineer |
| System Availability | <99.9% | <99% | Execute incident response |
| Memory Usage | >80% | >90% | Auto-scale/restart service |

## Monitoring Implementation

### Application Logging

#### Log Levels
- **TRACE**: Fine-grained debugging information
- **DEBUG**: Debugging information, disabled in production
- **INFO**: Normal application behavior, key events
- **WARN**: Potential issues that don't affect core functionality
- **ERROR**: Runtime errors that need attention but don't crash
- **CRITICAL**: Severe errors causing system failure

#### Structured Logging
```csharp
// Example structured logging
logger.LogError(
    exception,
    "Failed to process order {OrderId} for customer {CustomerId}. Reason: {Reason}",
    order.Id,
    customer.Id,
    exception.Message);
```

#### Required Context
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for the request
- **User ID**: Identifier of the affected user (if applicable)
- **Session ID**: Current user session
- **Service/Component**: Which service generated the error
- **Environment**: Production/Staging/Development
- **Version**: Software version
- **Stack Trace**: For errors
- **Correlation ID**: For tracing requests across services

### Distributed Tracing

#### Trace Components
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for the entire transaction
- **Span ID**: Identifier for a specific operation within the trace
- **Parent Span ID**: Reference to the parent operation
- **Timing Information**: Start time, duration
- **Tags/Attributes**: Key-value pairs for filtering and analysis

#### Implementation
```csharp
// Example using OpenTelemetry in .NET
public async Task<OrderResult> ProcessOrderAsync(Order order)
{
    using var activity = MyActivitySource.StartActivity("ProcessOrder");
    activity?.SetTag("order.id", order.Id);
    activity?.SetTag("order.amount", order.TotalAmount);
    
    try
    {
        // Process the order
        var result = await _orderProcessor.ProcessAsync(order);
        activity?.SetTag("order.status", "success");
        return result;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        activity?.SetTag("order.status", "failed");
        activity?.SetTag("error", true);
        activity?.SetTag("error.message", ex.Message);
        activity?.RecordException(ex);
        throw;
    }
}
```

### Metrics Collection

#### Key Metrics
- **Counter**: Number of occurrences (e.g., http_requests_total)
- **Gauge**: Point-in-time value (e.g., memory_usage_bytes)
- **Histogram**: Distribution of values (e.g., http_request_duration_seconds)
- **Summary**: Similar to histogram but with quantiles

#### Implementation
```csharp
// Example metrics in .NET using Prometheus
private static readonly Counter HttpRequestsTotal =
    Metrics.CreateCounter("http_requests_total", "Total number of HTTP requests", 
        new CounterConfiguration
        {
            LabelNames = new[] { "method", "endpoint", "status" }
        });

private static readonly Histogram HttpRequestDuration =
    Metrics.CreateHistogram("http_request_duration_seconds", 
        "HTTP request duration in seconds",
        new HistogramConfiguration
        {
            LabelNames = new[] { "method", "endpoint" },
            Buckets = new[] { 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 }
        });

// In request handling code
using (HttpRequestDuration.WithLabels(request.Method, endpoint).NewTimer())
{
    try
    {
        // Handle request
        HttpRequestsTotal.WithLabels(request.Method, endpoint, "200").Inc();
    }
    catch
    {
        HttpRequestsTotal.WithLabels(request.Method, endpoint, "500").Inc();
        throw;
    }
}
```

### Health Checks

#### Types of Health Checks
- **Liveness**: Is the service running?
- **Readiness**: Is the service ready to accept requests?
- **Startup**: Is the service initialized correctly?
- **Dependency**: Are external dependencies available?

#### Implementation
```csharp
// Example health checks in ASP.NET Core
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHealthChecks()
        // Basic liveness check
        .AddCheck("self", () => HealthCheckResult.Healthy(), 
            tags: new[] { "liveness" })
        // Database dependency check
        .AddDbContextCheck<ApplicationDbContext>(
            name: "database",
            failureStatus: HealthStatus.Degraded,
            tags: new[] { "readiness" })
        // External API dependency check
        .AddUrlGroup(
            new Uri("https://api.external-service.com/health"),
            name: "external-service-api",
            failureStatus: HealthStatus.Degraded,
            tags: new[] { "readiness" });
}
```

## Incident Response

### Error Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Response Time | Who to Notify |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| P1 | Critical | System down or unusable, severe business impact | Immediate | All hands, executive team |
| P2 | High | Major functionality broken, significant business impact | < 30 minutes | On-call team, manager |
| P3 | Medium | Minor functionality issues, limited business impact | < 2 hours | On-call engineer |
| P4 | Low | Cosmetic issues, no business impact | Next business day | Add to backlog |

### Incident Management Process
1. **Detection**: Automatic alert or user report
2. **Triage**: Assess impact and priority
3. **Notification**: Alert appropriate personnel
4. **Investigation**: Identify root cause
5. **Mitigation**: Implement temporary fix
6. **Resolution**: Deploy permanent solution
7. **Post-mortem**: Document and learn

### Post-Incident Analysis
- What happened?
- Why did it happen?
- How was it detected?
- How was it fixed?
- What was the impact?
- How can we prevent it in the future?

## Continuous Improvement

### Error Budget Policy
- Define acceptable error rate/downtime
- Allocate "budget" for failures
- When budget is depleted, focus on reliability over features
- Reset budget on fixed intervals (quarterly)

### Error Trends Analysis
- Week-over-week error rate changes
- New error types emerging
- Most improved error categories
- Correlation with deployments or traffic patterns

### Learning from Failures
- Regular review of major incidents
- Share learnings across teams
- Build runbooks for common failures
- Update monitoring based on missed signals

## Integration with Development Cycle

### Pre-Deployment
- Define monitoring requirements for new features
- Add appropriate logging and instrumentation
- Set up alerts for critical paths
- Establish baseline performance metrics

### During Deployment
- Monitor error rates in real-time
- Compare metrics to previous version
- Ready to roll back if anomalies detected
- Gradually increase traffic (canary deployment)

### Post-Deployment
- Review error rates after 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week
- Check for new error types
- Validate monitoring coverage
- Update monitoring if gaps found

## Special Considerations

### Privacy & Security
- Sanitize PII/sensitive data in logs
- Implement role-based access to monitoring tools
- Audit access to error logs
- Comply with data protection regulations

### Resource Consumption
- Monitor the monitors (overhead)
- Sample high-volume logs when necessary
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Consider cost vs. benefit for detailed tracing

### Custom Business Metrics
- Track business-specific KPIs
- Correlate technical errors with business outcomes
- Create custom service level indicators (SLIs)
- Define business-aligned service level objectives (SLOs)

## Tool-Specific Implementation Examples

### Azure Application Insights
```csharp
// Configure Application Insights in .NET
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(Configuration["ApplicationInsights:ConnectionString"]);
    
    // Custom telemetry initializer
    services.AddSingleton<ITelemetryInitializer, CustomTelemetryInitializer>();
}

// Track custom events
public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
{
    try
    {
        // Process order logic
        _telemetryClient.TrackEvent("OrderProcessed", 
            new Dictionary<string, string> { 
                { "OrderId", order.Id.ToString() },
                { "CustomerId", order.CustomerId.ToString() },
                { "OrderValue", order.Total.ToString() }
            });
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _telemetryClient.TrackException(ex, 
            new Dictionary<string, string> { 
                { "OrderId", order.Id.ToString() },
                { "FailureStep", "Processing" }
            });
        throw;
    }
}
```

### Grafana Alert Rules (PromQL)
```
# Alert when error rate exceeds 5% over 5 minutes
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) 
  / 
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) * 100 > 5

# Alert on API latency spike
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job="api"}[5m])) by (le, endpoint)) > 2

# Alert on database connection pool saturation
max_over_time(hikaricp_connections_usage_ratio[5m]) > 0.8
```

### ELK Stack Search Queries
```
# Find all 500 errors from a specific service
status:500 AND service:user-api AND NOT "health check"

# Find errors affecting a specific customer
error:true AND customer.id:12345

# Correlation across services with traceId
traceId:abcdef123456 AND level:ERROR

# Detect authentication failures
message:"authentication failed" AND NOT ip:"internal-network"
```
