# 📋 Document Review Checklist Template
*Systematic validation questions for maintaining document alignment*

## 🎯 Review Overview

This checklist provides mandatory validation questions for each foundational document type to ensure continuous alignment throughout the development lifecycle.

**When to Use**: 
- Before major component implementation
- At milestone checkpoints (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- When context validation triggers document review
- When positioning framework detects potential drift

## 📄 Original Requirements/Prompt Review

### Core Business Purpose Validation

### Data Design Validation
- [ ] **What data structures and flows are documented?**
- [ ] **How should data be processed, stored, and retrieved?**
- [ ] **What data validation and security requirements exist?**
- [ ] **Does my data handling align with the documented design?**

### Integration Design Validation
- [ ] **How should this component integrate with other system parts?**
- [ ] **What APIs, events, or communication patterns are specified?**
- [ ] **What error handling and resilience patterns are required?**
- [ ] **Does my integration approach match the design specifications?**

## 📊 Implementation Plan Review

### Milestone Progress Validation
- [ ] **Which milestone am I currently working on?**
- [ ] **What deliverables are expected for this milestone?**
- [ ] **What percentage of the milestone is complete?**
- [ ] **Am I on track to deliver the milestone as planned?**

### Task and Timeline Validation
- [ ] **What specific tasks are defined for current work?**
- [ ] **What is the estimated effort and timeline for each task?**
- [ ] **Which tasks are complete, in progress, or pending?**
- [ ] **Are there any timeline risks or scope changes needed?**

### Dependency Validation
- [ ] **What dependencies exist for current work?**
- [ ] **Are all prerequisite tasks and components complete?**
- [ ] **What external dependencies or blockers exist?**
- [ ] **How do I handle dependency changes or delays?**

### Quality Gate Validation
- [ ] **What quality criteria must be met for current milestone?**
- [ ] **What testing, documentation, or review requirements exist?**
- [ ] **How will milestone completion be validated?**
- [ ] **What quality gates remain before project completion?**

## 🎯 Current State/Session Progress Review

### Progress Context Validation
- [ ] **What work has been completed in the current session?**
- [ ] **What work is currently in progress?**
- [ ] **What work is planned for the immediate next steps?**
- [ ] **How does current progress align with overall project status?**

### Decision Context Validation
- [ ] **What key technical decisions have been made recently?**
- [ ] **What alternatives were considered and why were they rejected?**
- [ ] **Are there any decisions that need to be revisited?**
- [ ] **How do recent decisions align with documented designs?**

### Issue Context Validation
- [ ] **What technical challenges or blockers have been encountered?**
- [ ] **How were previous issues resolved?**
- [ ] **What lessons learned should inform current work?**
- [ ] **Are there any unresolved issues that impact current work?**

### Quality Context Validation
- [ ] **What code quality, testing, or documentation standards apply?**
- [ ] **How has quality been maintained throughout the project?**
- [ ] **What quality debt or technical debt exists?**
- [ ] **How will quality be validated for current work?**

## 🔍 Cross-Document Alignment Validation

### Requirements-Design Alignment
- [ ] **Do the design documents satisfy all functional requirements?**
- [ ] **Are there any requirements not addressed in the design?**
- [ ] **Do design decisions conflict with any requirements?**
- [ ] **How are requirement changes reflected in design documents?**

### Design-Implementation Alignment
- [ ] **Does the current implementation match design specifications?**
- [ ] **Are there any design decisions not yet implemented?**
- [ ] **Do implementation choices deviate from documented designs?**
- [ ] **How are design changes reflected in implementation plans?**

### Plan-Reality Alignment
- [ ] **Does the implementation plan reflect the actual work needed?**
- [ ] **Are there any plan assumptions that proved incorrect?**
- [ ] **How does actual progress compare to planned progress?**
- [ ] **What plan adjustments are needed based on current reality?**

## 🚨 Misalignment Detection

### Red Flag Indicators
- [ ] **Am I implementing features not mentioned in requirements?**
- [ ] **Am I violating documented architectural principles?**
- [ ] **Am I significantly behind or ahead of the implementation plan?**
- [ ] **Am I making decisions that contradict documented designs?**

### Warning Sign Indicators
- [ ] **Do I feel uncertain about whether my approach is correct?**
- [ ] **Have I not referenced design documents recently?**
- [ ] **Am I solving problems not mentioned in requirements?**
- [ ] **Am I making architectural decisions without design validation?**

### Recovery Actions
- [ ] **Stop current work and re-read relevant documents**
- [ ] **Create alignment plan to address misalignment**
- [ ] **Update documents if they are outdated or incorrect**
- [ ] **Seek clarification on ambiguous or conflicting requirements**
