### Event Store
```sql
-- Event Sourcing for User Actions
CREATE TABLE user_events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    version INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## üîÑ Event-Driven Architecture

### Event Types
```typescript
// Domain Events
interface UserFollowedEvent {
    userId: string;
    followedUserId: string;
    timestamp: Date;
}

interface PostCreatedEvent {
    postId: string;
    userId: string;
    content: string;
    mediaUrls: string[];
    hashtags: string[];
    timestamp: Date;
}

interface PostLikedEvent {
    postId: string;
    userId: string;
    timestamp: Date;
}
```
