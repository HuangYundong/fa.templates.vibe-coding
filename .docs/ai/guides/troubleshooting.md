# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions when using the AI Coding Framework.

## 🤖 AI Agent Issues

### Agent Not Following Framework Guidelines

**Problem**: AI agent ignores framework patterns or makes incorrect architectural decisions.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Verify super-prompt is complete

   - Copy entire contents of `.github/prompts/initialize.md`
   - Don't truncate or modify the prompt
   - Include all sections and guidelines

2. ✅ Restart conversation with framework

   - Begin new conversation session
   - Lead with the super-prompt
   - Follow with your project requirements

3. ✅ Explicitly reference framework
   "Please follow the AI Coding Framework guidelines
   and iDesign architectural principles as specified."
```

### Agent Asks Too Many Questions

**Problem**: AI agent asks for clarification on decisions it should make automatically.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Emphasize autonomous operation
   "Please make reasonable assumptions and proceed
   automatically without asking for confirmation."

2. ✅ Reference auto-progression rules
   "Follow the automatic progression rules in section 5.1.2
   of the framework."

3. ✅ Provide more context upfront
   - Include similar application examples
   - Specify scale and performance requirements
   - Mention technology preferences clearly
```

### Inconsistent Code Quality

**Problem**: Generated code doesn't follow SOLID principles or clean code practices.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Reinforce coding standards
   "Please ensure all code follows SOLID principles,
   includes comprehensive documentation, and uses
   appropriate design patterns."

2. ✅ Request code review
   "Please review the generated code for SOLID compliance
   and refactor any violations."

3. ✅ Specify quality requirements
   "Ensure 100% test coverage and include detailed
   XML documentation for all public APIs."
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Issues

### Wrong Architecture Pattern Selected

**Problem**: AI chooses monolith for complex requirements or microservices for simple projects.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Specify scale explicitly
   "This will support 100,000+ concurrent users with
   complex business workflows."

2. ✅ Mention complexity indicators

   - Number of distinct business domains
   - Team size and structure
   - Scalability requirements
   - Integration complexity

3. ✅ Override architecture choice
   "Please use microservices architecture for this
   project due to team distribution and scaling needs."
```

### Missing Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Problem**: Generated solution lacks logging, monitoring, or security features.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Explicitly request comprehensive features
   "Include complete logging, monitoring, security,
   and error handling throughout the solution."

2. ✅ Reference framework guidelines
   "Follow the security framework and error handling
   guidelines in the documentation."

3. ✅ Specify production requirements
   "This needs to be production-ready with full
   observability and security compliance."
```

## 🔐 Security Issues

### Weak Authentication Implementation

**Problem**: Basic or insecure authentication patterns.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Specify security requirements
   "Implement OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect with
   multi-factor authentication support."

2. ✅ Reference security framework
   "Follow the Zero Trust architecture patterns
   from the security framework documentation."

3. ✅ Mention compliance needs
   "Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance with proper
   data protection and user consent flows."
```

### Missing Input Validation

**Problem**: API endpoints lack proper validation and sanitization.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Emphasize security-first design
   "Implement comprehensive input validation,
   XSS prevention, and SQL injection protection."

2. ✅ Request validation patterns
   "Use data annotations and fluent validation
   for all input models with detailed error messages."

3. ✅ Specify attack prevention
   "Include CSRF tokens, rate limiting, and
   request size limits on all endpoints."
```

## 🧪 Testing Issues

### Insufficient Test Coverage

**Problem**: Generated tests don't cover edge cases or have low coverage.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Specify coverage requirements
   "Ensure 100% code coverage with unit, integration,
   and E2E tests for all functionality."

2. ✅ Request comprehensive test scenarios
   "Include tests for happy path, error conditions,
   edge cases, and security scenarios."

3. ✅ Mention test types needed
   "Create unit tests for business logic, integration
   tests for APIs, and E2E tests for user workflows."
```

### Tests Not Running

**Problem**: Generated test projects fail to build or execute.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Verify test project setup

   - Check project references
   - Ensure test packages are installed
   - Validate test configuration files

2. ✅ Check naming conventions

   - Test class names end with "Tests"
   - Test methods follow naming patterns
   - Test projects have proper structure

3. ✅ Validate test data setup
   - Mock configurations are correct
   - Test databases are accessible
   - Test data initialization works
```

## 🚀 Deployment Issues

### Docker Build Failures

**Problem**: Generated Dockerfiles fail to build or run.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Check Dockerfile syntax

   - Verify base image versions
   - Ensure COPY commands are correct
   - Check WORKDIR and EXPOSE instructions

2. ✅ Validate build context

   - Ensure all referenced files exist
   - Check .dockerignore patterns
   - Verify relative paths are correct

3. ✅ Test multi-stage builds
   - Each stage builds successfully
   - Dependencies are installed correctly
   - Application starts without errors
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflows fail to execute.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Check workflow syntax

   - YAML structure is valid
   - Job dependencies are correct
   - Action versions are specified

2. ✅ Verify secrets and variables

   - Required secrets are configured
   - Environment variables are set
   - Permissions are adequate

3. ✅ Test pipeline steps locally
   - Build commands work locally
   - Test commands execute successfully
   - Deployment scripts function correctly
```

## 📊 Performance Issues

### Slow Database Queries

**Problem**: Generated database queries perform poorly.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Request query optimization
   "Optimize all database queries with appropriate
   indexes and efficient LINQ expressions."

2. ✅ Specify performance requirements
   "All queries should execute in under 100ms
   with proper pagination and filtering."

3. ✅ Ask for performance analysis
   "Include query execution plans and performance
   benchmarks for all database operations."
```

### Memory or CPU Issues

**Problem**: Application consumes excessive resources.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Request resource optimization
   "Implement proper memory management, connection
   pooling, and resource disposal patterns."

2. ✅ Specify performance targets
   "Application should use less than 512MB RAM
   and maintain sub-second response times."

3. ✅ Ask for profiling code
   "Include performance monitoring and profiling
   code to identify bottlenecks."
```

## 🔄 Framework Updates

### Outdated Patterns or Libraries

**Problem**: Generated code uses outdated libraries or patterns.

**Solutions**:

```markdown
1. ✅ Specify version requirements
   "Use the latest LTS versions of all frameworks
   and libraries (.NET 8, React 18, etc.)."

2. ✅ Request modern patterns
   "Use current best practices including async/await,
   dependency injection, and modern C# features."

3. ✅ Update framework regularly
   - Check for framework updates
   - Review new best practices
   - Update examples and documentation
```
