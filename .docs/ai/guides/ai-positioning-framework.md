# 🧭 AI Positioning Framework
*Where Am I? What's My Mission? How Do I Stay On Track?*

## 📍 Positioning Overview

The AI Positioning Framework provides systematic awareness of:
- **Current Position**: Where the AI is in the development lifecycle
- **Mission Context**: The original business purpose and system goals
- **Alignment Status**: How current work relates to design documents and plans
- **Next Actions**: What should happen next based on positioning analysis

## 🎯 Core Positioning Questions

### 1. Mission Alignment
```markdown
**Original Business Purpose**: [From original prompt/requirements]
**Current System Goal**: [What we're building and why]
**Mission Drift Risk**: [High/Medium/Low based on recent actions]
```

### 2. Architectural Position
```markdown
**Design Document Status**: [Last reviewed, alignment score]
**Current Component**: [What I'm working on now]
**Architecture Compliance**: [Compliant/Deviation detected/Under review]
```

### 3. Plan Progress Position
```markdown
**Current Milestone**: [Which milestone we're in]
**Progress Percentage**: [X% complete based on plan]
**Plan Deviation**: [None/Minor/Major - with details]
```

### 4. Quality Position
```markdown
**Last Quality Gate**: [When and what was validated]
**Current Quality Status**: [Green/Yellow/Red]
**Pending Validations**: [What needs to be checked]
```

## 🔄 Positioning Protocols

### Mandatory Positioning Checkpoints

#### Before Major Component Implementation
```markdown
🧭 **POSITIONING CHECKPOINT**
- [ ] Read relevant design document sections
- [ ] Validate component fits architectural patterns
- [ ] Confirm business purpose alignment
- [ ] Check plan milestone alignment
- [ ] Review quality requirements
```

#### At 25%, 50%, 75% Milestone Completion
```markdown
🧭 **MILESTONE POSITIONING**
- [ ] Re-read original requirements
- [ ] Validate delivered features match plan
- [ ] Check architectural consistency
- [ ] Assess quality gate compliance
- [ ] Plan next milestone alignment
```

#### When Context Validation Triggers
```markdown
🧭 **CONTEXT-DRIVEN POSITIONING**
- [ ] Validate current work against positioning
- [ ] Check for mission drift indicators
- [ ] Review document freshness
- [ ] Assess plan relevance
- [ ] Update positioning status
```

## 📊 Positioning Status Indicators

### Mission Alignment Status
- **🟢 Aligned**: Current work directly supports original business purpose
- **🟡 Tangential**: Work is related but indirect to mission
- **🔴 Drifted**: Current work doesn't support original mission
- **⚠️ Unknown**: Mission alignment unclear, requires review

### Architecture Alignment Status
- **🟢 Compliant**: Following documented architectural patterns
- **🟡 Variant**: Minor deviation with justification
- **🔴 Non-compliant**: Major deviation from design documents
- **⚠️ Undefined**: Architecture not documented for current component

### Plan Alignment Status
- **🟢 On Track**: Following generated plan timeline and scope
- **🟡 Minor Deviation**: Small scope or timeline adjustments
- **🔴 Major Deviation**: Significant plan changes required
- **⚠️ Plan Unclear**: Current work not mapped to plan

## 🎯 Positioning Validation Protocol

### Step 1: Mission Context Validation
```markdown
**Action**: Read original prompt/requirements document
**Validate**: 
- [ ] Current component serves original business purpose
- [ ] Implementation approach matches system goals
- [ ] No mission drift from original intent

**If Misaligned**: Stop current work, re-read requirements, re-align approach
```

### Step 2: Architecture Context Validation
```markdown
**Action**: Read relevant design document sections
**Validate**:
- [ ] Component follows documented patterns
- [ ] Interfaces match specifications
- [ ] Dependencies align with architecture

**If Misaligned**: Review design documents, adjust implementation
```

### Step 3: Plan Context Validation
```markdown
**Action**: Read generated implementation plan
**Validate**:
- [ ] Current milestone matches plan expectations
- [ ] Progress percentage aligns with plan timeline
- [ ] Deliverables match planned scope

**If Misaligned**: Update plan or adjust scope to match current reality
```

### Step 4: Quality Context Validation
```markdown
**Action**: Review quality requirements and standards
**Validate**:
- [ ] Code quality meets standards
- [ ] Testing requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation requirements met

**If Misaligned**: Address quality gaps before proceeding
```

## 🎯 AI Positioning Checklist

### Before Starting New Work
- [ ] **Mission Check**: Re-read original requirements if >5 actions since last read
- [ ] **Architecture Check**: Review design docs for current component
- [ ] **Plan Check**: Validate current work against implementation plan
- [ ] **Progress Check**: Confirm milestone and percentage completion
- [ ] **Quality Check**: Review standards for current work type

### During Development Work
- [ ] **Alignment Monitor**: Check each major decision against positioning
- [ ] **Drift Detection**: Monitor for signs of mission/architecture drift
- [ ] **Progress Validation**: Confirm work advances plan milestones
- [ ] **Quality Awareness**: Maintain quality standards throughout

### After Completing Work
- [ ] **Position Update**: Update current position based on completed work
- [ ] **Alignment Validation**: Confirm delivered work meets all positioning criteria
- [ ] **Next Position**: Identify where AI should be positioned next
- [ ] **Handoff Context**: Provide clear positioning context for next work

## 🔄 Integration with Context Validation

### Enhanced Context Validation Format
```markdown
**Action [X/5]**: [Current action description]

🧭 **AI Positioning Status**:
- Mission: [🟢🟡🔴⚠️] [Brief status]
- Architecture: [🟢🟡🔴⚠️] [Brief status]  
- Plan: [🟢🟡🔴⚠️] [Brief status]
- Quality: [🟢🟡🔴⚠️] [Brief status]

💾 **Context Validation**: [Status from context persistence protocol]
📋 **Next Action**: [What happens next with positioning awareness]
```

## 🎯 Positioning Recovery Protocols

### When Mission Drift Detected
1. **Stop Current Work**: Pause implementation immediately
2. **Re-read Requirements**: Review original prompt and business purpose
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify where and why drift occurred
4. **Realignment Plan**: Create plan to return to mission alignment
5. **Validation**: Confirm realignment before proceeding

### When Architecture Deviation Detected
1. **Review Design Docs**: Re-read relevant architectural specifications
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate deviation impact on system integrity
3. **Correction Strategy**: Plan approach to return to compliance
4. **Implementation**: Execute correction with validation checkpoints
5. **Documentation**: Update positioning status and lessons learned

### When Plan Misalignment Detected
1. **Plan Review**: Re-read implementation plan and current milestone
2. **Reality Check**: Compare actual progress to planned progress
3. **Plan Update**: Adjust plan to reflect current reality or adjust scope
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure plan changes align with business goals
5. **Forward Planning**: Update next actions based on new plan alignment

## 📈 Positioning Metrics
