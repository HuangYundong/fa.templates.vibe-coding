# üéØ Systematic Document Anchoring Protocol

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: June 9, 2025  
**Framework Component**: Intelligence & Document Alignment

## üéØ Protocol Overview

This protocol ensures **100% alignment** with foundational project documents by mandating systematic re-reading and validation of design documents, original requirements, and implementation plans throughout the development lifecycle.

## üö® MANDATORY DOCUMENT ANCHORING CHECKPOINTS

### **Document Review Triggers**

**MANDATORY document anchoring is required in these scenarios:**

```markdown
COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION TRIGGER:
Before implementing ANY component ‚Üí READ relevant design documents
- /.docs/designs/2-system-components.md (architecture validation)
- /.docs/designs/3-class.md (component specification validation)
- /.docs/designs/4-sequence.md (workflow validation)

MILESTONE CHECKPOINTS:
- 25% Progress ‚Üí READ original requirements and business purpose
- 50% Progress ‚Üí FULL requirements and design document review
- 75% Progress ‚Üí Plan validation and scope alignment check
- 100% Progress ‚Üí Complete alignment validation

PROGRESS VALIDATION (Every 10%):
Read implementation plans and validate current progress against roadmap
- .github/plans/*.md (tactical implementation validation)
- Current milestone status vs. planned timeline
```

### **Document Anchoring Procedure**

**STEP 1: Document Identification** *(Based on Current Activity)*
```markdown
FOR COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION:
‚ñ° Identify component in /.docs/designs/2-system-components.md
‚ñ° Read component specification in /.docs/designs/3-class.md
‚ñ° Review related workflows in /.docs/designs/4-sequence.md
‚ñ° Check UI specifications in /.docs/designs/5-frontend.md (if applicable)

FOR MILESTONE CHECKPOINTS:
‚ñ° Read original prompt/requirements (conversation history or requirements doc)
‚ñ° Review business purpose and user needs
‚ñ° Validate current scope against original objectives
‚ñ° Check business value alignment

FOR PROGRESS VALIDATION:
‚ñ° Read relevant plan documents in .github/plans/
‚ñ° Compare current progress against planned milestones
‚ñ° Validate timeline and resource expectations
‚ñ° Check dependency and integration status
```

**STEP 2: Alignment Validation** *(Mandatory Questions)*
```markdown
DESIGN DOCUMENT ALIGNMENT:
‚úÖ Does current implementation match designed component specification?
‚úÖ Are component relationships following documented architecture?
‚úÖ Do API endpoints align with designed system interfaces?
‚úÖ Is UI implementation following design system specifications?

REQUIREMENTS ALIGNMENT:
‚úÖ Does current work serve the original business purpose?
‚úÖ Are we solving the original user problems identified?
‚úÖ Is system scope consistent with original objectives?
‚úÖ Are business rules being implemented as originally understood?

PLAN ALIGNMENT:
‚úÖ Is current progress consistent with planned timeline?
‚úÖ Are dependencies being addressed as planned?
‚úÖ Is resource allocation matching expectations?
‚úÖ Are quality gates being achieved as scheduled?
```

**STEP 3: AI Positioning Update** *(Where We Are)*
```markdown
AI POSITIONING ASSESSMENT:
‚ñ° Current Phase: [Discovery|Planning|Design|Implementation|Testing|Deployment]
‚ñ° Specific Activity: [What exactly are we working on now?]
‚ñ° Completed Components: [List with validation status]
‚ñ° Next 1-2 Actions: [Specific next steps with document references]
‚ñ° Blockers/Dependencies: [Current obstacles or waiting dependencies]
‚ñ° Quality Gate Status: [Build/Test/Lint current status]
```

## üìö DOCUMENT-SPECIFIC ANCHORING PROTOCOLS

### **Design Document Anchoring**

**Before ANY Component Implementation:**

```markdown
MANDATORY DESIGN DOCUMENT REVIEW:

1. READ Component Specification:
   - Component purpose and responsibilities
   - Interface definitions and contracts
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Implementation constraints and requirements

2. VALIDATE Current Approach:
   - Does implementation plan match design specification?
   - Are interface contracts being implemented correctly?
   - Are component relationships being established as designed?
   - Are design patterns being followed consistently?

3. DOCUMENT Alignment Status:
   - ‚úÖ ALIGNED: Implementation matches design specification
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVIATION: Implementation differs from design (document reasoning)
   - ‚ùå CONFLICT: Implementation contradicts design (requires resolution)

DESIGN DEVIATION PROTOCOL:
IF implementation differs from design specification:
1. DOCUMENT the specific deviation and technical reasoning
2. EVALUATE if design document needs updating or implementation needs adjustment
3. UPDATE design document if deviation is beneficial and justified
4. PROCEED only with documented, justified approach
```

### **Original Requirements Anchoring**

**At Major Milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%):**

```markdown
MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS REVIEW:

1. RE-READ Original Business Purpose:
   - What problem does this system solve?
   - Who are the primary users and what are their needs?
   - What business value does this system provide?
   - What are the core success criteria?

2. VALIDATE Current Direction:
   - Are we still solving the original problem?
   - Do current features serve the identified user needs?
   - Is business value being delivered as intended?
   - Are we meeting original success criteria?

3. ASSESS Scope Alignment:
   - Has scope expanded beyond original objectives?
   - Are we building features not in original requirements?
   - Have user needs evolved and been properly documented?
   - Is timeline realistic for original scope?

REQUIREMENTS DRIFT DETECTION:
RED FLAGS that indicate requirements drift:
‚ùå Building features not in original requirements
‚ùå User needs significantly different from original understanding
‚ùå Business value proposition has changed without documentation
‚ùå Success criteria no longer align with current implementation
‚ùå Timeline expectations unrealistic for original scope

REQUIREMENTS DRIFT RESOLUTION:
1. HALT current work if significant drift detected
2. DOCUMENT all changes and evolution from original requirements
3. VALIDATE changes with stakeholder perspective
4. UPDATE requirements documentation with evolved understanding
5. ADJUST implementation plan to align with validated requirements
```

### **Implementation Plan Anchoring**

**Every 10% Progress Completion:**

```markdown
MANDATORY PLAN VALIDATION:

1. READ Current Milestone Plan:
   - What should be completed at this percentage?
   - What are the planned next actions?
   - What dependencies should be resolved?
   - What quality gates should be achieved?

2. COMPARE Actual vs. Planned Progress:
   - Are completed components matching planned deliverables?
   - Is timeline tracking as expected?
   - Are dependencies being addressed on schedule?
   - Are quality gates being achieved as planned?

3. VALIDATE Next Actions:
   - Do planned next actions still make sense?
   - Are priorities and sequencing still optimal?
   - Are resource requirements realistic?
   - Are integration points ready as planned?

PLAN DEVIATION INDICATORS:
‚ö†Ô∏è Completed work differs from planned deliverables
‚ö†Ô∏è Timeline significantly ahead or behind expectations
‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies not resolved as scheduled
‚ö†Ô∏è Quality gates not achieved as planned
‚ö†Ô∏è Resource requirements higher than expected

PLAN ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL:
1. DOCUMENT specific deviations from original plan
2. ANALYZE root causes of deviations
3. ADJUST plan to reflect current reality and lessons learned
4. UPDATE timeline and resource expectations
5. PROCEED with adjusted, realistic plan
```

## üéØ AI POSITIONING FRAMEWORK

### **AI State Awareness Protocol**

**Required for EVERY progress message:**

```markdown
AI POSITIONING ANCHOR:
üß† Current Focus: [Specific component/feature being implemented]
üìç Implementation Phase: [Requirements|Design|Code|Test|Deploy]
üéØ Position in Plan: [X% through current milestone]
üìã Last Document Read: [Most recent design/plan document reviewed]
‚è≠Ô∏è Next Document Due: [When next document review is required]
üîÑ Alignment Status: [All docs aligned | Minor deviation | Major deviation]
```

### **Positioning Validation Questions**

**Ask and answer these questions regularly:**

```markdown
AI POSITIONING VALIDATION:
1. WHERE ARE WE?
   - What specific component/feature are we implementing?
   - What percentage of the current milestone is complete?
   - What phase of implementation are we in (requirements/design/code/test)?

2. WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING?
   - According to design documents, what should this component include?
   - According to the plan, what should be our current priority?
   - According to requirements, what user value should we be delivering?

3. ARE WE ALIGNED?
   - Does current work match design specifications?
   - Is current progress matching planned timeline?
   - Are we solving the original business problem?

4. WHAT'S NEXT?
   - What are the next 1-2 specific actions?
   - What documents need to be reviewed for next actions?
   - What dependencies or blockers need attention?
```

## üìä DOCUMENT FRESHNESS & EVOLUTION TRACKING

### **Document Validation Status**

**Track and validate document currency:**

```markdown
DOCUMENT FRESHNESS TRACKING:
/.docs/designs/1-use-cases.md: [‚úÖ Current | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor drift | ‚ùå Outdated]
/.docs/designs/2-system-components.md: [‚úÖ Current | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor drift | ‚ùå Outdated]
/.docs/designs/3-class.md: [‚úÖ Current | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor drift | ‚ùå Outdated]
/.docs/designs/4-sequence.md: [‚úÖ Current | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor drift | ‚ùå Outdated]
/.docs/designs/5-frontend.md: [‚úÖ Current | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor drift | ‚ùå Outdated]
.github/plans/*.md: [‚úÖ Current | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor drift | ‚ùå Outdated]

FRESHNESS CRITERIA:
‚úÖ CURRENT: Document accurately reflects current understanding and implementation
‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR DRIFT: Document mostly accurate with small gaps or outdated details
‚ùå OUTDATED: Document significantly different from current reality
```

### **Document Evolution Protocol**

**When documents need updating:**

```markdown
DOCUMENT UPDATE TRIGGERS:
- Technical constraints require design changes
- User feedback reveals requirement gaps
- Implementation discovers design improvements
- Timeline or resource constraints require plan adjustments

DOCUMENT UPDATE PROCESS:
1. IDENTIFY specific sections that need updating
2. DOCUMENT the reason for changes (technical/business/constraint-driven)
3. UPDATE document with current understanding
4. VALIDATE updated document against implementation reality
5. ENSURE all related documents remain consistent
6. NOTIFY team of significant document changes
```

## üîß INTEGRATION WITH CONTEXT VALIDATION

### **Enhanced Context Validation with Document Anchoring**

**Updated 5-Action Validation Procedure:**

```markdown
ENHANCED CONTEXT VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
‚ñ° Action counter validation (every 5 actions)
‚ñ° Session state file reading and validation
‚ñ° Document anchoring based on current activity:
  - Component work ‚Üí Design document review
  - Milestone reached ‚Üí Requirements alignment check
  - Progress increment ‚Üí Plan validation
‚ñ° AI positioning awareness and documentation
‚ñ° Context carry-over validation with document alignment
‚ñ° Quality gates validation including document consistency
```
