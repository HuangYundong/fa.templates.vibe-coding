# 📊 Enhanced Progress Tracking Template

## Milestone-Based Progress System

### Core Milestones (Standardized Percentages)

```markdown
📍 DISCOVERY & PLANNING (0-20%)

- 0-5%: Requirements gathering & visual inspiration
- 6-10%: Architecture design & example pattern selection
- 11-15%: Design document creation & validation
- 16-20%: Implementation plan finalization

📍 FOUNDATION SETUP (21-35%)

- 21-25%: Repository structure creation & tooling setup
- 26-30%: Backend project structure & base configuration
- 31-35%: Frontend project structure & design system setup

📍 CORE IMPLEMENTATION (36-65%)

- 36-40%: Database models & data access layer
- 41-45%: Business logic engines & core services
- 46-50%: API controllers & endpoint implementation
- 51-55%: Frontend components & state management
- 56-60%: Integration & real-time features
- 61-65%: Authentication & authorization

📍 QUALITY & TESTING (66-85%)

- 66-70%: Unit tests & test coverage
- 71-75%: Integration tests & API testing
- 76-80%: End-to-end tests & user workflows
- 81-85%: Security testing & vulnerability scanning

📍 DEPLOYMENT & FINALIZATION (86-100%)

- 86-90%: CI/CD pipeline & containerization
- 91-95%: Production deployment & monitoring setup
- 96-99%: Documentation completion & quality verification
- 100%: Project completion & handoff
```

### Progress Message Format (Enhanced)

```markdown
📍 **[MILESTONE: {milestone_name}] ({percentage}%) - {current_action}**
🔄 Context: {where_we_are} | Next: {next_1-2_actions}
📚 Design Ref: {design_document_section}
🏗️ Architecture: {component_type} following {pattern_example}
✅ Status: {completion_confirmation}
🎯 Quality: Linting {clean/warnings}, Build {success/issues}, Tests {pass/fail}
📊 Coverage: {test_coverage}% | 🔒 Security: {scan_status}
🎨 Visual: {design_direction_status}
```

### Context Validation Triggers

```markdown
MANDATORY CONTEXT CHECKS (Every 10% Progress):

- [ ] Milestone alignment with plan
- [ ] Design document compliance
- [ ] Architecture pattern consistency
- [ ] Framework standards adherence
- [ ] Quality gates status
- [ ] Visual design direction clarity
- [ ] Next actions specificity
```

### Self-Navigation Decision Tree

```markdown
IF unsure about next step:

1. Read current session state
2. Check milestone completion status
3. Reference design documents
4. Apply framework patterns
5. Validate against quality standards
6. Proceed with progress update

IF encountering errors:

1. Analyze error type and scope
2. Reference framework error handling
3. Apply appropriate resolution strategy
4. Update session state with resolution
5. Continue with corrected approach

IF context seems lost:

1. Execute recovery command sequence
2. Rebuild context from session state
3. Validate workspace consistency
4. Update progress tracking
5. Resume with full context anchor
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Session State Update Protocol

```markdown
UPDATE TRIGGERS:

- Every 10% milestone completion
- Before/after major architecture decisions
- During error resolution processes
- When switching between implementation phases
- After design document modifications

UPDATE CONTENT:

- Progress percentage and milestone
- Recent accomplishments and decisions
- Current files and components status
- Quality gate results
- Next actions with context
- Framework pattern adherence status
```

### Framework Intelligence Integration

```markdown
PATTERN RECOGNITION:

- Match requirements to example patterns
- Apply smart technology defaults
- Reference appropriate documentation
- Validate design consistency
- Ensure framework compliance

QUALITY MONITORING:

- Continuous linting validation
- Build status tracking
- Test coverage monitoring
- Security scan integration
- Design alignment verification
```

### Visual Design Progress Tracking

```markdown
DESIGN PHASE TRACKING:

- Inspiration gathering status
- Design system creation progress
- Component implementation alignment
- Visual quality validation
- Responsive design completion
- Accessibility compliance verification
```

This enhanced progress tracking system provides:

- ✅ Standardized milestone percentages for consistent navigation
- ✅ Rich context in every progress message
- ✅ Framework intelligence integration
- ✅ Quality gate monitoring
- ✅ Visual design progression tracking
- ✅ Self-navigation decision support
- ✅ Context recovery automation
